India's march toward modernity was led by courageous reformers who questioned age-old practices and advocated for social justice, women's rights, and educational reform. These visionaries faced fierce opposition from conservative forces yet persisted in their campaigns to create a more equitable society.

Raja Rammohun Roy stands as the archetypal Indian reformer—fighting against suttee, championing women's education, promoting Western learning while preserving Indian values, and founding the Brahmo Samaj. His life exemplifies the difficult path of progressive reform in 19th-century India. This collection will expand to include other reform movements and their leaders.
