Indian classical literature represents one of the world's oldest and richest literary traditions. From the sublime hymns of the Rig Veda to the courtly poetry of Kālidāsa, from Buddhist scriptures to the great epics of the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyana, these works have shaped not only Indian culture but world literature.

This collection presents English renderings of classical Indian poetry and texts, making accessible the beauty, wisdom, and philosophical depth of works that have been treasured for millennia. Each text offers a window into the values, aspirations, and artistic achievements of ancient Indian civilization.
