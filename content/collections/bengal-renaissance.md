The Bengal Renaissance was a cultural, social, social, intellectual, and artistic movement that took place in Bengal during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Pioneered by figures like Raja Rammohun Roy, this period saw the emergence of modern Indian thought, literature, and social reform.

From Rammohun Roy's campaigns against suttee and for women's education to Toru Dutt's mastery of English and French poetry, the Bengal Renaissance produced some of India's most influential thinkers and writers. This collection brings together biographical works that illuminate the lives and contributions of these remarkable individuals who bridged Eastern wisdom and Western learning.
