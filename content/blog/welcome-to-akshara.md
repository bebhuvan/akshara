The word *Akshara* comes from Sanskrit, meaning both "letter" and "imperishable; eternal." It is a fitting name for a project dedicated to ensuring that India's written wisdom remains freely accessible to all.

## The Problem We're Solving

While much of the world's knowledge has been digitized and made freely available online, countless Indian texts—historical accounts, literary works, and cultural documents—remain trapped in poorly scanned PDFs or forgotten entirely in dusty archives.

These are not obscure curiosities. They include foundational works by scholars like Max Müller, R.C. Dutt, and K.A. Nilakanta Sastri; speeches by Sarojini Naidu and writings by Lala Lajpat Rai; colonial-era gazetteers and comprehensive histories that remain primary sources for understanding India's past.

## What We Do

Project Akshara carefully extracts, cleans, and formats these texts for modern readers. We use AI-assisted extraction to digitize scanned pages, then meticulously review and correct the output. The result is clean, readable text that can be enjoyed on any device.

Every book on Akshara is:

- **Freely accessible** — No paywalls, no subscriptions
- **Beautifully formatted** — Designed for comfortable reading
- **Downloadable** — Available in multiple formats for offline use
- **Searchable** — Full-text search across all books

## Our Growing Library

We've begun with works that span India's intellectual history:

- Vedic studies and religious texts
- Colonial-era economic analyses
- Biographical works on reformers and visionaries
- Comprehensive historical narratives
- Literary collections and translations

Each book is carefully contextualized with information about its author, historical period, and significance.

## Join the Journey

This is just the beginning. Thousands of books await digitization, and we're committed to bringing them into the light. If you're interested in contributing—whether through suggestions for texts to digitize, corrections to existing works, or technical help—we'd love to hear from you.

The written word, after all, is imperishable. Let's ensure it remains accessible.
