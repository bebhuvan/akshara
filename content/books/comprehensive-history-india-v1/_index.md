This 1862 text presented unique challenges with archaic spellings, complex footnote structures, and dense historical content. Footnotes have been preserved inline with their respective chapters. Accuracy is estimated at 95%+. The text has been split into logical book divisions (Books I, II, III) as intended by the original author. If you find value in this work, credit goes to me for making it readable; errors can be attributed to OCR limitations and the complexity of 19th-century typesetting."

Henry Beveridge's monumental work provides a sweeping narrative of Indian history from ancient times to the Sepoy Revolt of 1857. Written in 1862, just five years after the rebellion, this three-volume history offers a contemporary perspective on the transformation of India under British rule.

The work is divided into three books: Book I covers ancient and medieval India from the earliest times to 1600; Book II traces the East India Company from its first charter to the amalgamation of rival companies; Book III chronicles the struggle for supremacy in India leading to the acquisition of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.

Beveridge combines detailed military history with social and cultural analysis, providing accounts of key figures like Alexander the Great's invasion, the rise of the Mughal Empire under Babar and Akbar, and pivotal moments such as the Battle of Plassey and Robert Clive's campaigns.
