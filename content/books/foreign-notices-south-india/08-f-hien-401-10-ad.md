### VIII. FĀ-HIEN (401-10 A.D.)

#### A. Dakṣiṇa and the Pigeon Monastery

There is a country named Dakṣiṇa[^12] where there is a monastery (dedicated to) the bygone Kaśyapa Buddha, and which has been hewn out from a large hill of rock. It consists in all of five storeys;—the lowest, having the form of an elephant, with 500 apartments in the rock; the second, having the form of a lion, with 400 apartments; the third, having the form of a horse, with 300 apartments; the fourth, having the form of an ox, with 200 apartments; and the fifth, having the form of a pigeon, with 100 apartments. At the very top there is a spring, the water of which, always in front of the apartments in the rock, goes round among the rooms, now circling, now curving, till in this way it arrives at the lowest storey, having followed the shape of the structure, and flows out there at the door. Everywhere in the apartments of the monks, the rock has been pierced so as to form windows for the admission of light, so that they are all bright, without any being left in darkness. At the four corners of the (tiers of) apartments, the rock has been hewn so as to form steps for ascending to the top (of each). The men of the present day, being of small size, and going up step by step, manage to get to the top; but in a former age they did so at one step. Because of this, the monastery is called Pārāvata, that being the Indian name for a pigeon. There are always Arhats residing in it.

The country about is (a tract of) uncultivated hillocks, without inhabitants. At a very long distance from the hill there are villages, where the people all have bad and erroneous views, and do not know the Śramaṇas of the Law of Buddha, Brāhmaṇas, or (devotees of) any of the other and different schools. The people of that country are constantly seeing men on the wing, who come and enter this monastery. On one occasion, when devotees of various countries came to perform their worship at it, the people of those villages said to them, ‘Why do you not fly? The devotees whom we have seen hereabouts all fly;’ and the strangers answered, on the spur of the moment, ‘Our wings are not yet fully formed.’

The kingdom of Dakṣiṇa is out of the way, and perilous to traverse. There are difficulties in connection with the roads; but those who know how to manage such difficulties and wish to proceed should bring with them money and various articles, and give them to the king. He will then send men to escort them. These will (at different stages) pass them over to others, who will show them the shortest routes. Fa-hien, however, was after all unable to go there; but having received the (above) accounts from men of the country, he has narrated them.

—Legge—*Fā-hien*, pp. 96-8 (cf. Giles—*Fa-hsien*, pp. 62-3; Beal *Buddhist Records* pp. lxviii-lxx.)

#### B. Tāmaliptī and Ceylon

Following the course of the Ganges, and descending eastwards for eighteen yojanas, he found on the southern bank the great kingdom of Campā,[^13] with topes reared at the places where Buddha walked in meditation by his vihāra, and where he and the three Buddhas, his predecessors sat. There were monks residing at them all. Continuing his journey east for nearly fifty yojanas, he came to the country of Tāmalipti,[^14] (the capital of which is) a sea-port. In the country there are twenty-two[^15] monasteries, at all of which there are monks residing. The Law of Buddha is also flourishing in it. Here Fā-hien stayed two years, writing out his Sūtras, and drawing pictures of images.

After this he embarked in a large merchant-vessel, and went floating over the sea to the south-west. It was the beginning of winter, and the wind was favourable; and, after fourteen days, sailing day and night, they came to the country of Singhala.[^16] The people said that it was distant (from Tāmaliptī) about 700 yojanas.

—Legge—*Fā-hien*, p, 100 (cf. Giles, *Fa-hsien*, pp. 65-66; Beal, *Buddhist Records* lxxi-lxxii).

#### C. Ceylon

The kingdom is on a large island, extending from east to west fifty yojanas, and from north to south thirty. Left and right from it there are as many as 100 small islands, distant from one another, ten, twenty, or even 200 li; but all subject to the large island. Most of them produce pearls and precious stones of various kinds; there is one which produces the pure and brilliant pearl,[^17] an island which would form a square of about ten *li*. The king employs men to watch and protect it, and requires three out of every ten such pearls, which the collectors find. The country originally had no human inhabitants,[^18] but was occupied only by spirits and nāgas, with which merchants of various countries carried on a trade. When the trafficking was taking place, the spirits did not show themselves. They simply set forth their precious commodities, with labels of the price attached to them; while the merchants made their purchases according to the price; and took the things away.[^19]

Through the coming and going of the merchants (in this way), when they went away, the people of (their) various countries heard how pleasant the land was, and flocked to it in numbers till it became a great nation. The (climate) is temperate and attractive, without any difference of summer and winter. The vegetation is always luxuriant. Cultivation proceeds whenever men think fit; there are no fixed seasons for it.

When Buddha came to this country,[^20] wishing to transform the wicked nāgas, by his supernatural power he planted one foot at the north of the royal city, and the other on the top of a mountain,[^21] the two being fifteen yojanas apart. Over the foot-print at the north of the city the king built a large tope, 400 cubits high,[^22] grandly adorned with gold and silver, and finished with a combination of all the precious substances. By the side of the tope he further built a monastery, called the Abhayagiri,[^23] where there are (now) five thousand monks. There is in it a hall of Buddha, adorned with carved and inlaid work of gold and silver, and rich in the seven precious substances, in which there is an image (of Buddha) in green jade, more than twenty cubits[^24] in height, glittering all over with those substances and having an appearance of solemn dignity which words cannot express. In the palm of the right hand there is a priceless pearl. Several years had now elapsed since Fā-hien left the land of Han; the men with whom he had been in intercourse had all been of regions strange to him; his eyes had not rested on an old and familiar hill or river, plant or tree; his fellow travellers, moreover, had been separated from him, some by death, and others flowing off in different directions; no face or shadow was now with him but his own, and a constant sadness was in his heart. Suddenly (one day), when by the side of this image of jade, he saw a merchant presenting as his offering a fan of white silk;[^25] and the tears of sorrow involuntarily filled his eyes and fell down.

A former king of the country had sent to Central India and got a slip of the patra tree,[^26] which he planted by the side of the hall of Buddha, where a tree grew up to the height of about 200 cubits.[^27] As it bent on one side towards the south-east, the king, fearing it would fall, propped it with a post eight or nine spans round.[^28] The tree began to grow at the very heart of the prop, where it met (the trunk);[^29] (a shoot) pierced through the post, and went down to the ground, where it entered and formed roots, that rose (to the surface) and were about four spans round. Although the post was split in the middle, the outer portions kept hold (of the shoot), and people did not remove them. Beneath the tree there has been built a vihāra, in which there is an image (of Buddha) seated, which the monks and commonalty reverence and look up to without ever becoming wearied. In the city there has been reared also the vihāra of Buddha’s tooth, on which, as well as on the other, the seven precious substances have been employed.

The king practises the Brahmanical purifications, and the sincerity of the faith and reverence of the population inside the city are also great. Since the establishment of government in the kingdom there has been no famine or scarcity, no revolution or disorder. In the treasuries of the monkish communities there are many precious stones, and the priceless *maṇis*. One of the kings (once) entered one of those treasuries, and when he looked all round and saw the priceless pearls, his covetous greed was excited, and he wished to take them to himself by force. In three days, however, he came to himself, and immediately went and bowed his head to the ground in the midst of the monks, to show his repentance of the evil thought. As a sequel to this, he informed the monks (of what had been in his mind), and desired them to make a regulation that from that day forth the king should not be allowed to enter the treasury and see (what it contained), and that no bhikṣu should enter it till after he had been in orders for a period of full forty years.

In the city there are many Vaiśya elders and So-po,[^30] whose houses are stately and beautiful. The lanes and passages are kept in good order. At the heads of the four principal streets there have been built preaching halls, where, on the eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth days of the month, they spread carpets, and set forth a pulpit, while the monks and the commonalty from all quarters come together to hear the Law. The people say that in the kingdom there may be altogether sixty thousand monks, who get their food from their common stores. The king, besides, prepares elsewhere in the city a common supply of food for five or six thousand more. When any want, they take their great bowls, and go (to the place of distribution), and take as much as the vessels will hold, all returning with them full.

The tooth of Buddha is always brought forth in the middle of the third month. Ten days beforehand the king grandly caparisons a large elephant, on which he mounts a man who can speak distinctly, and is dressed in royal robes, to beat a large drum, and make the following proclamation:

‘The Bodhisattva, during three Asaṅkhyeyakalpas,[^31] manifested his activity, and did not spare his own life. He gave up kingdom, city, wife, and son; he plucked out his eyes and gave them to another; he cut off a piece of his flesh to ransom the life of a dove; he cut off his head and gave it as an alms; he gave his body to feed a starving tigress; he grudged not his marrow and brains. In many such ways as these did he undergo pain for the sake of all living. And so it was, that, having become Buddha, he continued in the world for forty-five years, preaching his Law, teaching and transforming, so that those who had no rest found rest, and the unconverted were converted. When his connection with the living was completed, he attained to pari-nirvāṇa (and died). Since that event, for 1497 years, the light of the world has gone out,[^32] and all living beings have had long-continued sadness. Behold! ten days after this, Buddha’s tooth will be brought forth, and taken to the Abhayagirivihāra. Let all and each, whether monks or laics, who wish to amass merit for themselves, make the roads smooth and in good condition, grandly adorn the lanes and by-ways, and provide abundant store of flowers and incense to be used as offerings to it.’

When this proclamation is over, the king exhibits, so as to line both sides of the road, the five hundred different bodily forms in which the Bodhisattva had in the course of his history appeared;—here as Sudāna,[^33] there as Sāma;[^34] now as the king of elephants; and then as a stag or a horse.[^35] All these figures are brightly coloured and grandly executed, looking as if they were alive. After this the tooth of Buddha is brought forth, and is carried along in the middle of the road. Everywhere on the way offerings are presented to it, and thus it arrives at the hall of Buddha in the Abhayagiri-vihāra. There monks and laics are collected in crowds. They burn incense, light lamps, and perform all the prescribed services, day and night without ceasing, till ninety days have been completed, when (the tooth) is returned to the vihāra within the city. On fast-days the door of that vihāra is opened, and the forms of ceremonial reverence are observed according to the rules.

Forty *li* to the east of the Abhayagiri-vihāra there is a hill, with a vihāra on it, called the Chaitya,[^36] where there may be 2,000 monks. Among them there is a Śramaṇa of great virtue, named Dharmagupta,[^37] honoured and looked up to by all the kingdom. He has lived for more than forty years in an apartment of stone, constantly showing such gentleness of heart, that he has brought snakes and rats to stop together in the same room, without doing one another any harm.

#### Cremation of an Arhat

South of the city seven *li* there is a *vihāra*, called the Mahā-vihāra, where 3,000 monks reside. There had been among them a Śramaṇa of such lofty virtue, and so holy and pure in his observance of the disciplinary rules, that the people all surmised that he was an Arhat. When he drew near his end, the king came to examine into the point; and having assembled the monks according to rule, asked whether the bhikṣu had attained to the full degree of Wisdom. They answered in the affirmative, saying that he was an Arhat. The king accordingly, when he died, buried him after the fashion of an Arhat, as the regular rules prescribed. Four or five *li* east from the *vihāra* there was reared a great pile of fire-wood, which might be more than thirty cubits square,[^38] and the same in height. Near the top were laid sandal, aloe, and other kinds of fragrant wood.

On the four sides (of the pile) they made steps by which to ascend it. With clean white hair-cloth, almost like silk, they wrapped (the body) round and round. They made a large carriage-frame, in form like our funeral car, but without the dragons and fishes.[^39]

At the time of the cremation, the king and the people, in multitudes from all quarters, collected together, and presented offerings of flowers and incense. While they were following the car to the burial-ground,[^40] the king himself presented flowers and incense. When this was finished, the car was lifted on the pile, all over which oil of sweet basil was poured, and then a light was applied. While the fire was blazing, every one, with a reverent heart, pulled off his upper garment, and threw it, with his feather-fan and umbrella, from a distance into the midst of the flames, to assist the burning. When the cremation was over, they collected and preserved the bones, and proceeded to erect a tope. Fā-hien had not arrived in time (to see the distinguished Shaman) alive, and only saw his burial.

At that time the king,[^41] who was a sincere believer in the law of Buddha and wished to build a new *vihāra* for the monks, first convoked a great assembly. After giving the monks a meal of rice, and presenting his offerings (on the occasion), he selected a pair of first-rate oxen, the horns of which were grandly decorated with gold, silver and the precious substances. A golden plough had been provided, and the king himself turned up a furrow on the four sides of the ground within which the building was to be. He then endowed the community of the monks with the population, fields and houses, writing the grant on plates of metal, (to the effect) that from that time onwards, from generation to generation, no one should venture to annul or alter it.

—Legge *op. cit.* pp. 101-109 (Cf. Giles *op. cit.* pp. 66-74; Beal, *op. cit.* lxxii—lxxviii).

#### D. Passage to Java

Fā-hien abode in this country (Ceylon) two years; and, in addition to his acquisitions in Patna, succeeded in getting a copy of the Vinaya-piṭaka of the Mahīśāsakāḥ (school);[^42] the Dīrghāgama and Samyuktāgama[^43] (Sūtras); and also the Samyukta-sañcaya-piṭaka;[^44]—all being works unknown in the land of Han. Having obtained these Sanskrit works, he took passage in a large merchantman, on board of which there were more than 200 men, and to which was attached by a rope a smaller vessel, as a provision against damage or injury to the large one from the perils of the navigation. With a favourable wind, they proceeded eastwards for three days, and then they encountered a great wind. The vessel sprang a leak and the water came in. The merchants wished to go to the smaller vessel; but the men on board it, fearing that too many would come, cut the connecting rope. The merchants were greatly alarmed, feeling their risk of instant death. Afraid that the vessel would fill, they took their bulky goods and threw them into the water. Fā-hien also took his pitcher (*kuṇḍikā*) and washing-basin, with some other articles, and cast them into the sea; but fearing that the merchants would cast overboard his books and images, he could only think with all his heart of Kwan-she-yin,[^45] and commit his life to (the protection of) the church of the land of Han, (saying in effect), ‘I have travelled far in search of our Law. Let me, by your dread and supernatural (power), return from my wanderings, and reach my resting-place!’

In this way the tempest continued day and night, till on the thirteenth day the ship was carried to the side of an island, where, on the ebbing of the tide, the place of the leak was discovered, and it was stopped, on which the voyage was resumed. On the sea (hereabouts) there are many pirates, to meet with whom is speedy death. The great ocean spreads out, a boundless expanse. There is no knowing east or west; only by observing the sun, moon and stars was it possible to go forward. If the weather were dark and rainy, (the ship) went as she was carried by the wind, without any definite course. In the darkness of the night, only the great waves were to be seen, breaking on one another, and emitting a brightness like that of fire, with huge turtles and other monsters of the deep (all about). The merchants were full of terror, not knowing where they were going. The sea was deep and bottomless, and there was no place where they could drop anchor and stop. But when the sky became clear, they could tell east and west, and (the ship) again went forward in the right direction. If she had come on any hidden rock, there would have been no way of escape.

After proceeding in this way for rather more than ninety days, they arrived at a country called Java-dvīpa, where various forms of error and Brahmanism are flourishing, while Buddhism in it is not worth speaking of. After staying there for five months, (Fā-hien) again embarked in another large merchantman, which also had on board more than 200 men. They carried provisions for fifty days, and commenced the voyage on the sixteenth day of the fourth month.

Legge—*Fā-hien* pp. 111-113 (Cf. Giles: *Fā-hsien* pp. 76-78; Beal *Buddhist Records* lxxix-lxxxi).

[^1]: Ras Fartak on the S. Coast of Arabia. It is an Arabic tribe-name: the Saukar, pl. Sawakir.

[^2]: Early geographers erroneously thought there was a deep indentation in the Arabian coast between Ras-el-Kelb and Ras Hasik, bisected by Ras Fartak or Syagrus Cape. This strip of coast is called by the Arabs Es-Shehr. The word Sachalites is from the Arabic *sahil*, coast.

[^3]: This may be Moseirah Channel.

[^4]: Arabic *Lihvan*: Bay of Bahrein.

[^5]: Northern shore of Persian Gulf; the name is Maisan, near the modern Basra, long an important trading port.

[^6]: Arabic Diklath. Hebrew Hiddekel. Mention of the single stream indicates that then as now, the Euphrates and Tigris discharged through a single mouth, the Shatt-el-Arab.

[^7]: (which in sec. 38 is said to be situated on the Gulf of Canthi) is probably Mandvi on the Gulf of Cutch, or Kachchh, an important commercial port in western India from early times.

[^8]: Is Comorin, the southernmost point of India. [More likely Pt. Calimere—KAN.]

[^9]: Pt. Palmyra? (KAN).

[^10]: Probably Masulipatam.

[^11]: The dimensions of India are vaguely stated. The "length" or longitude calculated between the deltas of the Indus and the Ganges, the length of the Ganges, the sailing course around India, and the width of the Ganges delta, are all overestimated, but the error is not great.

[^12]: Said to be the ancient name for the Deccan. As to the various marvels in the chapter, it must be borne in mind that our author, as he tells us at the end, only gives them from hearsay. See ‘Buddhist Records of the Western World,’ Vol. II, pp. 214-215, where the description, however, is very different.—Legge.

[^13]: Probably the modern Champanagar, three miles west of Baglipoor, lat. 25° 14'N., lon. 56° 55'E.—Legge.

[^14]: Then the principal emporium for the trade with Ceylon and China; the modern Tam-look, lat. 22° 17'N., lon. 88° 2'E.; near the mouth of the Hoogly.—Legge.

[^15]: Twenty-four.—Beal.

[^16]: ‘The Kingdom of the Lion,’ Ceylon. Singhala was the name of a merchant adventurer from India, to whom the founding of the kingdom was ascribed. His father was named Singha, ‘the Lion,’ which became the name of the country;—Singhala or Singha-Kingdom, ‘the country of the Lion.’—Legge.

[^17]: Called the *maṇi*, pearl or bead. *Maṇi* is explained as meaning ‘free from stain,’ ‘bright and growing purer.’ It is a symbol of Buddha and of his Law. The most valuable rosaries are made of *maṇis*.—Legge.

[^18]: According to other accounts Singhala was originally occupied by Rākṣasas or Rakṣas, ‘demons who devour men,’ and ‘beings to be feared,’ monstrous cannibals or anthropophagi, the terror of the shipwrecked mariner. Our author’s ‘spirits’ were of a gentler type. His dragons or nāgas come before us again and again.—Legge.

[^19]: cf. Pliny, ante re. Seres.

[^20]: That Śākyamuni ever visited Ceylon is to me more than doubtful. Hardy, in M.B. pp. 207-213, has brought together the legends of three visits—in the first, fifth, and eighth years of his Buddhaship. It is plain, however, from Fā-hien’s narrative, that in the beginning of our fifth century, Buddhism prevailed throughout the island. Davids in the last chapter of his ‘Buddhism’ ascribes its introduction to one of Asoka’s missions, after the Council of Patna, under his son Mahinda, when Tissa, ‘the delight of the gods,’ was King (B.C. 250-230).—Legge.

[^21]: This would be what is known as ‘Adam’s peak,’ having, according to Hardy (pp. 211, 212, notes), the three names of Selesumano, Samastakūṭa, and Samanila. There is an indentation on the top of it, a superficial hollow, 5 feet 3¾ inches long and about 2½ feet wide. The Hindus regard it as the footprint of Śiva; the Mohammedans, as that of Adam; and Buddhists, as in the text,—as having been made by Buddha.—Legge.

[^22]: 470 feet.—Beal.

[^23]: Meaning ‘The Fearless Hill.’ There is still the Abhayagiri tope, the highest in Ceylon, according to Davis, 250 feet in height, and built about B.C. 90, by Waṭṭa Gāmini, in whose reign, about 160 years after the Council of Patna, and 330 years after the death of Śākyamuni, the Tripiṭaka was first reduced to writing in Ceylon—‘Buddhism,’ p. 234.—Legge.

[^24]: About 22 feet.—Beal.

[^25]: We naturally suppose that the merchant-offerer was a Chinese, as indeed the Chinese texts say, and the fan such as Fā-hien had seen and used in his native land.—Legge.

[^26]: This should be the pippala, or bodhidruma, generally spoken of, in connection with Buddha, as the Bo tree, under which he attained to the Buddhaship. It is strange our author should have confounded them as he seems to do. In what we are told of the tree here, we have, no doubt, his account of the planting, growth, and preservation of the famous Bo tree, which still exists in Ceylon. It has been stated in a previous note that Asoka’s son, Mahinda, went as the apostle of Buddhism to Ceylon. By-and-by he sent for his sister Sanghamittā, who had entered the order at the same time as himself, and whose help was needed, some of the king’s female relations having signified their wish to become nuns. On leaving India, she took with her a branch of the sacred Bo tree at Buddha Gaya, under which Śākyamuni had become Buddha. Of how the tree has grown and still lives we have an account in Davids’ ‘Buddhism.’ He quotes the words of Sir Emerson Tennent, that it is ‘the oldest historical tree in the world;’ but this must be denied if it be true, as Eitel says, that the tree at Buddha Gaya, from which the slip that grew to be this tree was taken more than 2,000 years ago, is itself still living in its place. We might conclude that Fā-hien, when in Ceylon, heard neither of Mahinda nor Sanghamittā.—Legge.

[^27]: 220 feet.—Beal.

[^28]: Placed eight or nine surrounding props to support the tree.—Beal.

[^29]: ‘Where the tree and prop met, the tree shot out.’—Giles.

[^30]: The phrase ‘Sabaean merchants’ suggested to Legge by Beal’s rendering of *So-po* is wrong; *So-po*, according to Pelliot, stands for *Sārthavāha*, a merchant-prince.—BEFEO, iv, p. 356, n. 1.

[^31]: A Kalpa denotes a great period of time; a period during which a physical universe is formed and destroyed. Asaṅkhyeya denotes the highest sum for which a conventional term exists:—according to Chinese calculations equal to one followed by seventeen ciphers; according to Thibetan and Singhalese, equal to one followed by ninety-seven ciphers. Every Mahākalpa consists of four Asaṅkhyeya-kalpas. Eitel, p. 15.—Legge.

[^32]: Compare *Sacred Books of the East*, Vol. XI, *Buddhist Suttas*, pp. 89, 121, and note on p. 89.—Legge.

[^33]: Sudāna or Sudatta was the name of the Bodhisattva in the birth which preceded his appearance as Śākyamuni or Gotama, when he became the Supreme Buddha. This period is known as Vessantara Jātaka of which Hardy, M.B. pp. 116-24, gives a long account; see also *Buddhist Birth Stories*, p. 158.—Legge.

[^34]: The *Sudāna Jātaka*, the same as *Vessantara Jātaka*; both this and the *Sāma Jātaka* are among the Sāñcī sculptures.—Beal. For the stories see *Jātakas* Nos. 547 and 540 respectively in the *Jātaka*, ed. Cowell, Vol. VI.

[^35]: In an analysis of the number of times and the different forms in which Śākyamuni had appeared in his Jātaka births, given by Hardy (M.B., p. 100), it is said that he had appeared six times as an elephant; ten times as a deer; and four times as a horse.—Legge.

[^36]: Chaitya is a general term designating all places and objects of religious worship which have a reference to ancient Buddhas, including therefore Stupas and temples as well as sacred relics, pictures, statues, &c. It is defined as ‘a fane,’ ‘a place for worship and presenting offerings.’ Eitel, p. 141. The hill referred to is the sacred hill of Mihintale, about eight miles due east of the Bo tree:—Davids’ *Buddhism*, pp. 230, 231.—Legge.

[^37]: Eitel says (p. 31): ‘A famous ascetic, the founder of a school, which flourished in Ceylon, A.D. 400.’ But Fā-hien gives no intimation of Dharmagupta’s founding a school.—Legge. Beal transcribes the name as Dharma-kōṭi also alternatively.

[^38]: 34 feet.—Beal.

[^39]: See the description of a funeral car and its decorations in the *Sacred Books of the East*, Vol. xxviii, the *Lī Kī*, Book xix. Fā-hien’s ‘in this (country),’ which I have expressed by ‘our,’ shows that whatever notes of this cremation he had taken at the time, the account in the text was composed after his return to China, and when he had the usages there in his mind and perhaps before his eyes.—Legge.

[^40]: The pyre served the purpose of a burial-ground or grave, and hence our author writes of it as such.—Legge.

[^41]: This king must have been Mahā-nāma (A.D. 410-432). In the time of his predecessor, Upatissa (A.D. 368-410), the piṭakas were first translated into Singhalese. Under Mahā-nāma, Buddhaghoṣa wrote his commentaries. Both were great builders of vihāras.—Legge.

[^42]: No. 1122 in Nanjio’s Catalogue, translated into Chinese by Buddhajīva and a Chinese Śramaṇa about A.D. 425. Mahīśāsakāḥ means ‘the school of the transformed earth,’ or ‘the sphere within which the Law of Buddha is influential.’ The school is one of the subdivisions of the Sarvāstivādāḥ. —Legge.

[^43]: Nanjio’s 545 and 504. The Āgamas or Sūtras of the Hinayāna, divided, according to Eitel, pp. 4, 5, into four classes, the first or Dīrgha-āgamas (long Āgamas) being treatises on right conduct, while the third class contains the Samyuktāgamas (mixed Āgamas).—Legge.

[^44]: Meaning ‘Miscellaneous Collections;’ a sort of fourth Piṭaka. See Nanjio’s fourth division of the Canon, containing Indian and Chinese miscellaneous works. But Dr. Davids says that no work of this name is known either in Sanskrit or Pāli Literature.—Legge.

[^45]: Kwan-she-yin and the dogmas about him or her are as great a mystery as Mañjuśrī. The Chinese name is a mistranslation of Avalokiteśvara . . . To the worshippers of whom Fā-hien speaks, Kwan-she-yin would only be Avalokiteśvara.—Legge.
