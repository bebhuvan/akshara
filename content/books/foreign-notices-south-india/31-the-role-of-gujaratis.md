### II. THE ROLE OF GUJARATIS

In February 1511, Albuquerque went from Cochin to Malaka with a flotilla of 18 ships: The Commentaries say:

"When they arrived at Ceylon, being East-West in relation to the isle of Sumatra, they descried a ship. Albuquerque gave orders to come alongside of it and they took it. They rejoiced much (to find) that it was a ship (armed) with Guzaratis, and they concluded from it that they were on the right path, for the (Gujaratis) know this route much better than all the other nations, because of the great commerce they have with these (eastern) countries."[^1]
