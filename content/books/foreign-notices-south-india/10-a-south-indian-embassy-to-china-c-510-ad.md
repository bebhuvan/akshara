### X. A SOUTH INDIAN EMBASSY TO CHINA C. 510 A.D.

"In the time of Seuen-woo, of the dynasty of the later Wei (A.D. 500-516), South India sent an ambassador to offer as presents some horses of a fine breed. This ambassador stated that the kingdom produced lions, leopards, panthers, camels, rhinoceroses and elephants; that there was a species of pearl there, called *ho-tse*, similar to talc (*yun-moo*), the colour of which was yellowish red (*tse*, reddish blue); if it is divided, it disperses like the wings of the cricket, if it is heaped up, on the other hand, it becomes compact, like threads of silk strongly woven. There were diamonds resembling amethysts (*tse-shih-ying*). When purified a hundred times in the fire, without melting, this diamond is used to cut Jasper (*yu* stone). There were also tortoise-shell (*tae-mei*), gold (*kin*), copper (*tung*), iron (*tee*), lead (*yuen*), tin (*seih*), fine muslins embroidered with gold and silver; there were also a variety of odoriferous plants, *yuh-kin*, sugar-canes, and all kinds of products; honey-bread (or solid honey), pepper, ginger and black-salt."

— "Chinese account of India. Translated from the *Wan-heen-t’hung-kaou*, or Deep Researches into Ancient Monuments;" by Ma Twan-lin; book 338 fol. 14. *Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal*, vi. p. 66; cf. JRAS., vi. p. 458; IA ix, p. 18.

[^1]: The Song capital was Nanking.

[^2]: What this stands for is unknown—cf. Krom, H.J.G. p. 83.

[^3]: Now Chao-tcheou in the province of Kouang-tong—(Chavannes).

[^4]: See JA. Sep.-Oct. 1903, pp. 199-209 and fig. 11 (Chavannes).

[^5]: It is now found in the Japanese Tripiṭaka—(Chavannes).

[^6]: The *Samyukta abhidharma hṛdaya śāstra*; this Chinese translation is now lost (Chavannes).

[^7]: The story that follows is very obscure; in my opinion, Houei-Kouo, Tsing-yin and the others are precisely the eight nuns from Ceylon referred to below. (Chavannes) Later, Chavannes and Lévi thought that Chinese women, seeing these nuns from Ceylon, demanded admission into the order, and the message to Ceylon was necessitated by this request. JA: 11: 8 (1916), pp. 45-6. Cf. also Pelliot BEFEO. iv. p. 275 n. 1, and p. 356 n. 4.

[^8]: Of the nuns, the first being that of the monks.

[^9]: There were only eight. It was perhaps necessary to have ten for forming a regular community.

[^10]: Guṇavarman died before this affair was fully regulated; when the nuns from Ceylon whom he had sent for arrived at the Capital, it was the Hindu Sanghavarman who was charged with the task of ordaining the nuns. (The biography of Sanghavarman follows that of Guṇavarman in the *Kao Seng tchouan*).—Chavannes.
