#### EIGHTH VOYAGE FROM ADEN TO GUJERAT.

If you start from Aden, you go true east till you lose sight of the mountains of Aden; you continue to hold the same route a day and a night, then E. by N., till the Southern wind sets in, then E. N. E. if possible, and if not, you follow the above course and go then E. N. E.; if there be little motion with the Awelama (?) there is no harm in it; if a closer course is pursued you side to E. by N. and return from thence again to E. N. E. till the measure is equal; in this measure Lyra[^2] is five inches, or Sagitta six inches, or Canopus and Lyra are equal to three inches and a half. Under this measure (height) you see in the sea frequently sea snakes, which ought to be taken care of, as it is a good sign; if you do not see them follow your way in the direction right east till you see them, and then change again your course to E. by N. till you see land. The best rule is to trust to the soundings and not to the sea-snakes, which, if they prove true, show themselves twice and thrice a day. Be it known, that sometimes in the monsoon *Damani* the ship is thrown by the current towards the Persian shore like mount Koholad Dabbaghat; at this time the ship finds itself in the barbarian channel; there great precaution is necessary against the whirlpools; besides this place there are such between Gujerat and Sind in the gulph Jakad, where the wind blows continually from the sea, and the current comes from the shore, so that waves and contrary currents are not wanting, and a ship falling in with them runs great risk to be lost, if it is not saved by the grace of God; so it is necessary to avoid these places. You must turn from the Persian shore to the Arabian, and steer N. N. E. and N. E. by N. till you are out of reach of this dangerous place, after which you steer again E.N.E. Know that the wind of Canopus (S.S.E.) is not to be trusted till the pole is made with six inches or six inches and a quarter; the flood runs then true E. The signs of a tempest are great distress, and the summer birds called in Yaman, *tijam*, also the birds *bani safaf* and *amm ul sanani*; these birds keep them to the shore, flying in the summer on the sea; sometimes you see them till where the pole is made with nine inches (Lat. 19°54').

—JASB. v (1836) pp. 456-57.

#### FOURTEENTH VOYAGE, FROM ADEN TO MONEMBAR, (MALABAR).

The course is the same which has been already mentioned before from Aden to Gujarat; you go on till the pole marks six inches and a half or seven inches;[^3] if from thence you can go tacking, you go in the direction of E. by S. or true east; if it is impossible to keep this course, your way is E. by N. till the pole is made by seven inches and half or eight inches; from thence you follow the direction E. by S. till the pole is made with six inches,[^4] then true east till land is in sight, which is A'zadiw[^5] or a place near it; you steer then towards the shore; what is meant by the inches, *assaba*, and the pole or polar star *jah* has been explained in the former chapters.

—ib. p. 458.

#### TWENTIETH VOYAGE, FROM DABUL TO THE ISLANDS OF DIB.

You follow first the direction W.S.W. till you lose the shore, from thence to Daira S.W. by W. till land is in sight; from thence S.S.E. till the pole comes to three inches, from thence to the south pole and S.S.W. till the Farkadain ($\beta$ and $\gamma$ in the little bear) are marked by eight inches and a half; from thence true west to Foyuka or its neighbourhood. Mark what has been said above; till land is in sight steering S.W. by W., that means, that the land is at hand. Be it known to you that in some of the islands of the Maldives the inhabitants hunt with dogs, bred to the purpose, the Orang-ootang (Nisnaus) and eat it. The Nisnaus is an animal resembling a monkey, but endowed with speech; but generally monkeys are also called Nisnaus. I have heard from the brother of Janum Hamza, the late Intendant of Egypt, that coming one day on commercial business at the extremity of Yaman to a walled village, he alighted at a house where two boys lying on the ground were crying, and that out of commiseration he untied their fetters. The master of the house, returning, laughed at it, and said, these are Nisnaus, which we hunt. The next day the master of the house took his disbelieving guest with him, and he saw the Nisnaus hunted by dogs. Some Nisnaus emerge from the sea, their flesh is a great dainty; that they are endowed with the power of speech is even recorded in the books of philosophers .

—ib. pp. 461-62.

#### TWENTY-SIXTH VOYAGE, FROM CALICUT TO KARDAFUN.

If you sail from Calicut with a favourable wind, steer W. by S. and sometimes W.S.W. so you come to the island Kolfaini;[^6] if at this time, that is to say, on the 140th day of the Yazdajerdian year, which the fifth of Jelalian (March), the sea shuts, the flood runs at this time N.N.W. from thence you direct your course to the south pole, and go tacking if the flood runs to the south pole, but if the wind falls lower, then this course to S.W., S.W. by S. and S.S.W, you may follow it a day and a night without inconvenience. If it should fall yet lower, turn and steer to the north pole or near it, particularly if the pole is made by less than three inches (lat. 10°), because it is profitable to be then high north, and the wind grows favourable; if it be already so, you run from Calicut till Kolfaini two *zams* in the direction of W. by S., then eight of nine *zams* W.S.W. then you may rejoice, as you have got clear of the islands of Ful, from thence W. by N. and W.N.W. till the pole is four inches and a quarter, and then true west to Kardafun. Calicut is famous for its pepper plantations: its Prince is the Saumeru who is at war with the Portuguese. On these coasts are a great number of elephants employed in dragging ships, launching them into the sea, and similar doings.

—ib. p. 465.

#### TWENTY-SEVENTH VOYAGE, FROM DIU TO MALACCA.

Leaving Diu you go first S.S.E. till the pole is five inches, and side then towards the land, till the distance between it and between the ship is six *zams*; from thence you steer S.S.E., because in the neighbourhood of Ceylon, the sea runs high, the further you keep off the more quiet the sea grows; you must not side all at once but by degrees, first till the *farkadain* ($\beta$ and $\gamma$ in the little bear) are made by a quarter less than eight inches, from thence to S.E. till the *farkadain* are seven inches and a quarter, from thence true east at a rate of 18 *zams*, then you have passed Ceylon. The sign of Ceylon being near is continual lightning, be it accompanied by rain or without rain; so that the lightning of Ceylon is grown proverbial for a liar. After having passed Ceylon you go E.N.E. and E. by N. till the pole is made by two inches, from thence true E. till to the island of Sarjal which is one of the Najbari (Nicobarian) islands. After having left it behind you steer E. by S. till land is in sight, you go along it to the islands Falusanbilen which are nine islands;7 from thence to the south pole. At your right some islands are seen at a distance, so you go towards the south pole till you come to the islands to Folodjora[^8] which appear near, from thence E.S.E. where the sea is more than ten fathoms, if it be 11 or 12 never mind, because after 12 is the deep sea, and you are clear of the Shob Kafaussi. You go till mount Folupasalar is opposite, N.E. till the soundings give 24 fathoms, because there is a bent *shab* running out in the sea, which is to be taken care of—wherefore your course must be followed always in a depth of 24 fathoms till you see the mount Folupasalar N.N.E.; then you steer towards the land and Diaraibarra (E.N.E.) till Malacca. The inhabitants of Shuli[^9](?) go from Falusanbilen two *zams* to the south pole.

—ib. pp. 465-66.

#### TWENTY-EIGHTH VOYAGE FROM DIU TO SHATIJAM,[^10] I.E., TO BENGAL.

Sailing from Diu, your course, till you have left Ceylon behind you, is the same as the above mentioned, then you steer N.E. Ceylon remaining on the western side; then N.E. by N. till you come opposite to Rakanj,[^11] where the pole is made with a quarter wanting to nine, and the Aselli scarce with six inches; if in this course you see land it is well; if not, steer E.N.E. till the pole is nine inches and a half, so you come to the island of Dardiw. If you see it at this time it is well, if not go right east till you see land, but take care of Fesht Hayumiun,[^12] which is a desert rock, round which the water is twenty fathoms deep; take care also of Dardiw[^13] where the water is but five fathoms. If Rakanj is in sight, go N.N.W. with 25 fathoms of water. At this time Hayumiun remains on your right, of which great care is to be taken. After having passed it you approach the land till your soundings give 16 fathoms, and with this course you come to Dardiw; after having left it behind you go with 12 fathoms depth N.N.W., there you come to a great Khur (?) called Bakal, and then five capes which are taken for islands by those who don't know them; then comes a Ghobba, that is to say, a gulf full of shallows, shoals and breakers; this place is called Kakar Diwa,[^14] then you come to the island Zenjilia[^15] which is facing you, your way lies N.N.W. When you approach this Island, side to the sea, because its southern cape is *rikk*, that is to say, a shallow, and the colour of the water grows white; meanwhile, on the sea side it is seen green. Hold that course, and you will find better soundings by degrees till you come to 17 and 18 fathoms. Coming to this place you find the water again whitish, these shallows are on the south side of Fesht Gurian, which is a desert place; here the sea is noisy, don't keep either too near to the island of Zenjilia, nor too far from it but steer a middle course; if the soundings give 18 fathoms or near it, you have passed Zenjilia; then you go in the direction of the north-pole, and continue to take soundings till you come to seven fathoms; from thence you steer in the direction of the north pole, and to the rising place of the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ of the little bear, till your soundings are six fathoms but not less. So you come to cape KHur which is Shatijam. Here you stop till the *rebban* (tide) come, with which you enter the port. Bengal is abundant in ivory and ebony; the finest muslin turbans, the very best *jutar*,[^17] and most precious Indian stuffs come from thence; the finest muslin sashes are called *malmal*, and the most precious of them *malmali-shahi*, which by confusion is generally named *marmare-shahi* (royal marble); there are also sea-bulls, the best of them are found between Bengal and Delhi in the interior lake; they are called sea bulls, although they don't live in the sea, but in the interior lakes on the land; but the merchants call them so; for in the interior northern lakes, in the mountains of the Afghans, are also found the rhinoceros (*Karkadan*, the name quite the same as the *Krokotos* of Ctesias), but their horns are but two palms long; it is related that those which are found in Abyssinia have much longer horns. Giraffes are found but in Abyssinia and never in India.

—JASB. v. (1836), pp. 466-67.

# ADDENDA

### I

The following notice of Ma Twan-lin (middle of the thirteenth century A.D.) is worth noting along with the passage from Pan Kou reproduced in extract II above:

#### HOANG-TCHI

The kingdom of Hoang-tchi sent, for the first time, some ambassadors at the time of Han and since the reign of Emperor Ou-ti[^1] regularly paid the visit of homage. It is situated at (a distance of) 30.000 *li* to the south of Hopou and Ji-nan.[^2] Its customs resembled those of the country of Tchu-yai.[^3] It furnished beautiful pearls, *lieouli*, fine stones, and many curious things. Pearls which are nearly two *tsun*[^4] in circumference are found there, and others smaller, with a perfect roundness, which when laid on a polished surface, keep moving the whole day, before coming to a standstill.

—*Ethnographie, Meridionaux*, ed. Hervey de Saint-Denys, pp. 412-13.

### II

The long notice on the Cōḷa country in Ma Twan-lin is well worth comparing with that of Chau Ju-kua (ante pp. 141-7). The two accounts have much in common, but there are also important differences which go to show the diverse character of the sources the two authors drew upon for composing their accounts:

#### TCHU-LIEN

On the eastern side, this kingdom is 5000 *li* along the seaboard. On the western side 1500 *li* separate it from Western India (Tien-tcho). On the southern side, it is situated 2,500 *li* from Lo-lan; and on the northern side 3,000 *li* from Tuntien. It had no communication with China in the olden days. In order to go there, setting out from Kouangtcheou, it is necessary to go by sea a distance of nearly 411,400 *li*.

The capital of Tchu-lien has seven enclosing walls, with a height of seven *tchi*, and a hundred paces apart from one another. The outermost enclosure has a diameter of twelve *li* from south to north, and seven *li* from east to west. The first four walls are built of brick; the two following are of mud, and that of the interior is of wood. All are covered with espaliers, or decorated with flowers. The first three enclosures are occupied by the people and include numerous water courses. The fourth enclosure contains the houses of four great officers. The fifth enclosure belongs to the sons of the king. In the sixth is a temple of Buddha, served by hundred Buddhist priests. Finally the seventh contains the palace of the king, or royal town, comprising more than four hundred buildings. The towns of the second order are thirty-one in number, twelve to the west of the royal residence, eight to the south, and eleven to the north. The reigning dynasty has occupied the throne for three generations.[^5]

The administration of justice is entrusted by the king to one of his four great officers. Those who have committed offences are put in fetters and receive from fifty to a hundred strokes with rods. The criminals are beheaded or crushed under the feet of an elephant.

During feasts, the king and the four great officers salute each other, crossing their hands, and inclining the body like the Buddhist priests; then they all sit together. They eat meat, but they do not drink wine. They have different sorts of soups, cakes and particular dishes of very good taste. They wear cotton clothes. The feast is accompanied by music, singing and dances. The service is done by women.

For marriages, the suitor sends at first a mediatrix to the family of the young girl, whom he courts, offering her a ring of gold or silver. Three days after, the relatives of the young man, join and consult together to determine if they could, according to their resources, give to the new household some fields, domestic animals, or only palm wine and some areca nuts and so on. From their side, the future relations send to the fiancé some gold or silver rings; some pieces of cloth; and some beautiful clothes for his wife. These preliminaries ended, if the young man refuses to marry the young girl, he should send back the tokens of betrothal that he has received, and if it is the young girl who wishes to retract, she ought to restore twice the presents she has accepted.

When war is carried on, the order of battle is as follows: In the front rank are placed the elephants, behind the elephants are the lightly armed men, protected with small shields; then soldiers armed with lances having points resembling the weaver's shuttle; then the infantry handling long swords; and lastly the archers forming the rear guard. The four great officers command all the available forces by divisions. About 2500 *li* to the south-east of the kingdom of Tchu-lien is the kingdom of Si-lantchi. War sometimes breaks out between these two countries. Tchu-lien produces pearls, coral, crystal, areca-nuts, nutmeg, cotton *ki-pei*, etc. Elephants, goats, oxen, pheasants, parrots; a lot of white jasmine and a quantity of other flowers, are also found there. Its fruits are the jujube, cocoanut palm, plum tree, jack, etc. The inhabitants cultivate the legumes, green and black, as well as many sorts of grains, notably wheat and rice. The bamboo thrives on their soil.

This kingdom which in antiquity never had communications with the Empire, sent ambassadors for the first time under the dynasty of Song. They arrived at the ninth moon, of the eighth year *ta-tchong-siang-fou* (1009); the chief of them, named Chali-san-ouen, was one of the four great officers of the reigning king Lo-tcha-lo-tcha. Then came a second ambassador named Pou-kia-sin and two councillors whose names were Ong-ou-fang and Ya-kin-kia. These strangers brought a letter from their sovereign for the Emperor, with the presents offered as tribute. They advanced right up to the steps of the throne, and there deposited these pearls and precious stones, on a tray, and drawing back to the furthest end of the hall of audience, made two deep bows. The interpreter explained that they meant by that to show their respect and their attachment from far as well as from near.

The letter of the king was more or less to the following effect: "I, Lo-tcha-lo-tcha, your subject, I have learnt through a merchant vessel which visited my kingdom that the great dynasty of Song was ruling the Empire, that already two emperors of your race had occupied the throne, that to-day the mandate of Heaven has been gloriously acquired by you. Some words of antiquity which have happily come to me, have first of all inspired the desire to render homage to you.[^6] Soon, I knew that your beneficial influence extends far, that your subjects are very submissive, that your high merit surpasses that of all your predecessors. You practise justice; you maintain peace by the sole power of your virtue. You are strong and formidable; but you do not like to strike. Also, all the peoples turn towards you. You know to instruct the men and serve the Supreme Lord with a sincere piety. Your goodness extends even to the feeble reed; it reaches the fishes in the depths of the sea. That is why Heaven enlightens you, and protects you; that is why the graces descend on you, manifest, constant and brilliant. I, your subject, I am humble and small; I reside, as have resided my ancestors, in a barbarous town, very far from the shining light of Chinese civilization. I see in some way, by the light of candles. However the noise of your praises which fills the world, could not fail to move me. My age, the stretch of the seas which separate us, and the great difficulties on the route to traverse, do not permit me to go, in order to carry myself the tribute that I wish to offer you; but if it is forbidden me to contemplate from near and with my own eyes, the brilliance of your glory, I pour out, at least in this letter, the sincerity of my heart, and I send you respectfully the best products of my country. Just as ants are attracted by a sweet smell, as the sun-flower is drawn towards the sun as by an irresistible charm, so will be my envoys, to the number of fifty-two, arriving at the foot of your throne. I have ordered them to offer you a robe and cap decorated with pearls, pearls of different sizes weighing about 21,000 *leang*;[^7] sixty pieces of ivory and sixty pounds of incense."

The ambassadors distributed besides, personally, their own presents, 6,600 *leang* of pearls and 3,300 pounds of perfumes.[^8]

The words of antiquity to which the king Lo-tcha-lo-tcha made allusion in his letter were those which had been pronounced by the skipper of the foreign vessel which visited his kingdom who had said: "During these ten years, there have been no storms at sea." The sense of these legendary words was that for ten years the Empire had for master a pious prince, endowed with all the virtues. Hence the desire of the king to send ambassadors to the court of China.

San Ouen[^9] and his suite, having navigated in the beginning during seventy-seven days and nights, and passed before the Isles No-ou-tan and Po-li-si-lan arrived at the kingdom of Tchen-pin. Pursuing their course, sailing night and day, and passing before the Isle Y-ma-lo-li, their vessel reached the coasts of the kingdom of Kou-lo after a sixty-one days' journey. The kingdom of Kou-lo contains a high mountain called Kou-lo, to which it owes its name. Again sixty-one days and nights of navigation, and the voyagers, after having left behind them the Isles Kia-pa, Kou-po-lao, and Tcheou-pao-long, anchored on the shores of San-fo-tsi. Continuing to advance during eighteen days and nights, after traversing the mouth of the river Man-chan and coasting the Isles of Tien-cho, they found themselves, in sight of the Isle of Pin-teou-lang, and could see in the distance, about 100 *li* towards the east, the tomb of Si-ouang mou.[^10] They travelled again twenty days and twenty nights, passed the Islands of Yang-chan and Kieou-sing-chan, touched at the island of Pi-pa, and landed finally at the port Koung-tcheou (Canton) after a voyage of 1,150 days.

The Emperor issued instructions to receive them with the greatest regard and to accord to them the same honours as to the envoys of Kouei-tse for all that concerns the ceremonial of audience, the invitations to official dinners, etc. As they celebrated this year, the tenth anniversary of the coming of Tchin-tsong,[^11] San-Ouen, and his companions went to the Buddhist temple of Ki-ching-chen-youen, wishing to unite their prayers with those of the Buddhist priests who invoked Heaven to accord longevity to this prince.

In the fourth year *tien-hi* (1020), a second embassy from Tchu-lien entered the port of Kouang-tcheou. Hardly had he disembarked, the first ambassador named Pa-lan-te-molie died of an exhausting illness. The credentials brought by him were sent to the court. The Emperor responded giving orders to treat honourably all the strangers who formed the suite of the late ambassador, and send them away with very rich presents.

In the second year *Ming-tao* (1033), a new ambassador of Tchu-lien, arrived. He bore a letter from his sovereign written in characters of gold. He offered as tribute a dress, and a cap ornamented with pearls, hundred and five *leang* of pearls and hundred pieces of ivory. This ambassador declared that many embassies which had left his country to go to China had been surprised by storms at sea, and had perished along with their goods. He showed a great desire to be able to advance right up to the base of the Imperial throne to perform there, with the pearls of the first choice, the ceremony called *Sa-tien*.[^12] the greatest evidence of respect and attachment in his own view. The permission having been given him, he put his pearls on a silver tray which he raised above his head after kneeling down; then he spread them at the feet of the Emperor. This ambassador was called Pou-ya-toli. Honorary titles were given to him.

In the tenth year *hi-ning* (1077) envoys of Tchu-lien appeared again at the court. They were twenty-seven in number. They offered pearls as big as peas, a big piece of *lieou-li*, camphor, the teeth of rhinoceros, beautiful textiles, incense, diverse perfumes, essence of roses, medicinal plants, borax and spices. The chief among them, having accomplished the ceremony of *Sa-tien*, the Emperor conferred on him a very high title and caused to be given to him precious medicines from the Imperial pharmacy. The other envoys were gratified with numerous presents, consisting above all of silks, and this embassy bore for the king of Tchu-lien 81,800 strings of cash[^13] with 52,000 taels of silver.[^14]

In conclusion, if we wish to examine seriously all that is just related (according to the annals) on this kingdom of Tchu-lien, situated precisely at the distance of 411,400 *li* by sea from the port of Kouang-tcheou, the voyage to it requiring a navigation of 1,150 days, one will scarcely find three facts meriting to be put beyond doubt: to know that Tchu-lien was a country very far from China, that it has never communicated with the Empire in olden days, and that it offered for the first time the tribute in the middle of the years *ta-tchong-siang-fou*. As to the letter of the king Lo-tcha-lo-tcha, it suffices to note its elaborate style, full of phrases and rhetoric purely Chinese, without the least foreign turn of inspiration, to judge that it has not even been drawn up at some distance by one of those emigrated half-literate Chinese who possesses the Kao-kiu-li and the Kiao-tchi. It is the work of a veritable litterateur of the Empire, whose brush is exercised to embellish or rather disfigure an original document supposing that an original document existed.

—*Ethnographie, Meridionaux*, ed. Hervey de Sanit-Denys, pp. 571-82.

### III

Ma Twan-lin on Nan-pi (Malabar) may also be compared with Chau Ju-kua's account (pp. 137-40 above) :

#### NAN-PI

This kingdom is to the southwest. A month is needed to go there, setting out from San-fo-tsi, at a favourable time. There are always continual winds there. When the king wishes to go out, he sends in advance, a squad of more than hundred soldiers, under the direction of many officers, in order to water the ground and beat the dust on the road he is to traverse. The prince takes very choice food. He is served varied dishes by hundreds and (this happens) two times every day. One of the great dignitaries of the court has the high direction of his cuisines.

The inhabitants of Nan-pi are very warlike. They manage skilfully the sabre and the lance. They are shrewd archers. They know to mint and strike silver coins with alloy which bear the royal seal of the State and which serve as currency for commerce. They fish for pearls and make cotton cloth of all colours. Because of its distance, this country lived without any relation with China, when two merchants who were natives of the land and who were called Chi-lo-pa-tchi-li-yu, father and son, came to establish themselves in the centre of the town of Tsiouen-tcheou (of Fokien). After this, many Chinese vessels took the route to Nan-pi in order to carry on trade.

—*Ethnographie, Meridionaux*, ed. Hervey de Saint-Denys, pp. 587-88.

### IV.

The following from Ibn Battūta should be read in continuation of XXX (B) at page 219:—

Of the false rumour which was spread on the death of the Sultan, and the flight of the Malik Hoshang.

As he returned to Daulat-a-bad, the sovereign was indisposed during the journey; the rumour ran among the people that he was dead. This news spread and was the cause of grave seditions. Malik Hoshang, son of Malik Kamāl-u-dīn Gurg, was then at Daulat-a-bad, and he had promised to the Sultan never to take the oath of obedience to any other than himself as long as the Sultan should live and even after his death. When he heard of the death of the sovereign he fled to an infidel prince named Burabrah who lived in inaccessible mountains between Daulat-a-bad and Koaken Tânah. The monarch was informed of his flight, and as he suspected trouble, he hastened to reach Daulat-a-bad. He followed Hoshang in his track and surrounded him with cavalry. He sent word to the Hindu prince to surrender him; but the latter refused saying, "I will not surrender my guest, not even when the consequence would be, as far as I am concerned, similar to what has happened to the king of Kanbilah." However Hoshang was frightened about himself; he expedited a message to the Sultan, and they thought it expedient that the latter should return to Daulat-a-bad; that Quṭlu KHān, the preceptor of the Sultan, should remain in order that Hoshang may receive some sureties from him and come to Quṭlu KHān with a safe conduct. The Sultan left, and Hoshang conferred with the preceptor who promised him that the monarch would not kill him or lower his rank in any way. Then he set out with his goods, his family, his people and went to the Sultan; the latter rejoiced at his arrival; he clothed him with the robe of honour and thus gratified him.

[^1]: Hobson-Jobson under *Java* cites the *Ras Mala*:

    Then for two generations to live upon,
    Money enough he brings back.
