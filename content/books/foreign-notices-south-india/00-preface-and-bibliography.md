## PREFACE

This is a source-book of Early South Indian History. Its aim is to present in a handy form the numerous Foreign Notices of South India including Ceylon scattered in several books and journals published by learned Societies not easily accessible to the general reader. In some cases the passages selected for inclusion have been specially rendered into English from French translations of Arabic or Chinese originals.

The sources included here comprise mainly Greek and Latin, Arabic, Chinese and Persian authors; but not being acquainted with their several languages, I have based this work altogether upon translations into modern European languages. Though the collection is not exhaustive, I believe nothing of importance has been omitted. The reasons for the choice of the extracts and their importance to students of South Indian History are briefly explained in the Introduction and notes, and will, I trust, be borne out by the extracts themselves.

I acknowledge with great pleasure the assistance of Dr. N. Venkataramanayya, who gave me the transliteration of proper names occurring in Ibn Battuta and also some of the notes to the same author; and of Miss K. M. Sowmini, who made some of the translations from French and checked the references to French periodicals.

Excepting Ibn Battuta, I have generally retained the forms of proper names as they appear in the authorities I have used.

For permission to include extracts I am indebted to M. Paul Pelliot, Directeur, *T’oung Pao*, for Nos. II, IX, XI, XVI, XXIV, XXXII, XXXIII, XXXIV A-B; to Archibald R. Maclean, Esq., for Nos. III, IV, VI and XII A i to iii, B and C, and to the High Commissioner for India, London, for procuring this permission; to the Director, Philadelphia Commercial Museum, for V and VII; to the Clarendon Press, Oxford, for Nos. VIII and XV B-D; to the General Secretary, Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta, for X, XIII and Appendix IV; to the Secretary, Royal Asiatic Society, London, for XIV, XXXIV C-D; to the Librarian, Société Asiatique, Paris, for XV A, XVIII, XXX A-BB, C-ii, Appendix i, ii and iii; to Secrétaire Général, Libraire Ernest Leroux, Paris, for XV E; to the Directeur, B.E.F.E.O., Hanoi, for XVII; to Dr. A. Rouhier of Libraire et Editions, Vega, Paris, who now represents Editions Bossard, for XIX; to Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench Trübner & Co., for XX; to the Honorary Secretary, Hakluyt Society, London, for XII A iv, XXII, XXVI, XXVII, XXVIII, XXX, C-i and XXXI; and to Messrs. John Murray, London, for XXV. Extracts No. XXI and XXIX are from publications issued under the auspices of the Governments of Burma and France. Finally, Extract No. XXIII is from *Chau Ju-kua* (Hirth and Rockhill) published by the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, with whom or whose representatives no communication could be established. Extract No. I contains matter which appeared in the *Indian Antiquary* (Vol. VI) and was also published in book form by Messrs. Thacker Spink & Co.; and is included with the permission of Mr. C. E. A. W. Oldham on behalf of the *Indian Antiquary*.

My thanks are due to the Syndicate of the University of Madras for including this work in the University Historical Series.

I must also thank the G. S. Press for the speedy and excellent execution of the work.
