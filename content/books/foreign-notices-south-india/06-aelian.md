### VI. AELIAN

#### Pearl-fishing

The Indian pearl-oyster (I have already spoken of the Erythraean kind) is caught in the following manner. There is a city which a man of royal extraction called Soras[^51] governed at the time when Eukratides governed the Baktrians,[^52] and the name of that city is Perimuda. It is inhabited by a race of fish-eaters who are said to go off with nets and catch the kind of oysters mentioned, in a great bay by which a vast extent of the coast is indented. It is said that the pearl grows upon a shell like that of a large mussel, and that the oysters swim in great shoals, and have leaders, just as bees in their hives have their queen-bees. I learn further that the leader is bigger and more beautifully coloured than the others, and that in consequence the divers have a keen struggle in the depths which of them shall catch him, since when he is taken they catch also the entire shoal, now left, so to speak, forlorn and leaderless, so that it stirs not, and, like a flock of sheep that has lost its shepherd, no longer moves forward against any incipient danger. As long, however, as the leader escapes and skilfully evades capture, he guides their movements and upholds discipline. Such as are caught are put into tubs to decay, and when the flesh has rotted and run off nothing is left but the round pebble. The best sort of pearl is the Indian and that of the Red Sea. It is produced also in the Western Ocean where the island of Britain is. This sort seems to be of a yellowish colour, like gold, while its lustre is dull and dusky. Juba tells us that the pearl is produced in the straits of the Bosporus and is inferior to the British, and not for a moment to be compared with the Indian and Red Sea kind. That which is obtained in the interior of India is said not to have the proper characteristics, but to be a rock crystal.

[^1]: See JRAS. 1860, p. 321 for a sceptical critique of this embassy.

[^2]: Intimate friend of Herod the Great and much esteemed by Augustus; he wrote a universal History in 144 books at the request of the former (McCrindle).

[^3]: Śramaṇācārya(?)

[^4]: Bargyza, Bharoch.

[^5]: "Florus, contemporary of Trajan (98-117 A.D.), also towards the close of his *Epitome of Roman History*, mentions the same embassy:—
'For both the Scythians and Sarmatians sent ambassadors begging our alliance. The Seres also and the Indians who live under the Sun, together with jewels and precious stones, bringing elephants also amongst their presents, reckoned nothing so much an obligation laid upon the Emperor, as the length of their journey, which they had finished in four years, and notwithstanding the complexion of the men showed that they came from another climate.'
Orosius, a native of Tarraco (Tarragona), (c. 420 A.D.), states in his *History* (vi. 12) that an Indian embassy reached Augustus at the time when he was residing in that city. As the date of this embassy does not tally with that noticed by Nicolaos, some have supposed that there were two different embassies, but this is highly improbable. Orosius is by no means an accurate historian.
Dion Cassius (ix. 58) (end of second century A.D.) also mentions this Indian embassy in these terms:—
'Numerous embassies came to him (Augustus at Samos, B.C. 21), and the Indians having first proclaimed a league of amity with him, obtained its ratification, and presented him, besides other gifts, with tigers also—animals seen then for the first time by the Romans, and, if I mistake not, even by the Greeks. They gave him also a stripling without arms (like the statues we see of Hermes), but as dexterous in using his feet as others their hands, for with them he could bend a bow, hurl a dart, and put a trumpet to his mouth. One of the Indians, Zarmaros, perhaps to make a show for the Athenians and Augustus who was then in Athens, resolved to put an end to his life. And having been initiated in the mysteries of the two gods (Demeter and Persephone) which were held out of the ordinary course on account of the initiation of Augustus, he committed his living body to the flames.' (McCrindle, *op. cit.* pp. 78-79.)

[^6]: "Who may as well be called the master fabulist as the master pilot of Alexander"—Strabo. (McCrindle, pp. 34-5).

[^7]: "The situation of Myos Hormos is determined by the cluster of islands now called Jifātin (lat. 27·12' N., long. 35·55' E.). It was founded by Ptolemy Philadelphos B.C. 274"—(McCrindle).

[^1]: As usual with classical writers, an exaggeration. "The extreme length of the island from North to South is 271½ miles, and its greatest width 137½ miles."—McCrindle.

[^2]: An amphora was a fortieth of a ton—McCrindle.

[^3]: This is mentioned in Buddhist stories also. See p. 5, n. 8.

[^4]: The S.W. Monsoon prevails from June to October (McCrindle).

[^5]: 41-54 A.D.

[^6]: Kudirimalai (?); contra JRAS 1904 pp. 539-41 where it is suggested that Taprobanê was probably Sumatra.

[^7]: There is no such lake in existence.

[^8]: Cape Kory, (from Kōḍi).

[^9]: The coral reefs (?)

[^10]: A fable or a misunderstanding on the part of the Romans.

[^11]: Again a fable.

[^12]: Note this early reference to Chinese trade.

[^13]: Cf. *Periplus*, Sec. 65 and Fā-hien, *post*. The Seres mentioned here cannot be Cēras, as has sometimes been thought, but the Chinese, and by the Hemodî mountains the Himālayas seem to be meant. Contra JRAS. 1904, pp. 359-62 where Kennedy upholds the Cēra view, and 539-41. See also IHQ. XIV. 3 (Winternitz Comm. Vol. pp. 487-9).

[^14]: Cf. I(C) Ante.

[^15]: Now Ras Fartak—McCrindle.

[^16]: Vincent identifies this port with Jaygadh. (McCrindle).

[^17]: Contra *Periplus* (54) on Muziris.

[^18]: "According to Dr. Burnell, Cottonara is Kolattu-nadu, the district about Tellicherry, the pepper district."—McCrindle.

[^1]: ‘According to the *Imp. Gaz. of India*, IX, 297, high spring tides in the Gulf of Cambay rise and fall as much as 33 feet, and run at a velocity of 6 to 7 knots an hour. Ordinary tides reach 25 feet, at 4½ to 6 knots. The inevitable damage to shipping, under such difficulties, was the cause of the desertion of the Cambay ports for Surat, and, more recently, Bombay.’— Schoff. Cf. Ibn Battuta.

[^2]: People of Gāndhāra, the modern Peshawar District.

[^3]: Cf. Skt. Puṣkalāvatī, the W. Capital of Gāndhāra.

[^4]: ‘Our author is confusing Alexander with Menander.’—Schoff. But the author’s meaning may be no more than that Alexander marched in the direction of the Ganges, neglecting the South.

[^5]: From Pāli: Ujjēnī.

[^6]: Kaśyapapura, (? Kashmir).

[^7]: Hindu Kush.

[^8]: Kabul.

[^9]: ‘The Roman *aureus* and *denarius* were current throughout W. India, and strongly influenced the Kuṣān and Kṣatrapa coinages.’—Schoff.

[^10]: Skt. Pratiṣṭhāna, mod. Paithān.

[^11]: Ter(?)—Fleet.

[^12]: Sopara, north of Bombay.

[^13]: Kalyān.

[^14]: Satakarni, title of some of the Andhra kings. Schoff thinks that the ‘elder Sarganus’ was Ariṣṭa Satakarṇi (44-69 A.D.) and Sandares, his heir-presumptive, Sundara. But it seems possible that Sandanes (not Sandares), Candana, was the title of a Kuṣān King (JA. Jan-March, 1936, pp. 75-85.)

[^15]: Mod. Chaul, about 25 miles south of Bombay—Schoff, whom I follow in the succeeding notes also.

[^20]: Deogarh.

[^21]: Mālvan.

[^22]: Vengurla rocks.

[^23]: Goa.

[^24]: Oyster rocks, west of and facing the roadstead of Kārwār.

[^25]: Kārwār, an active port as late as the 16th century, exporting fine muslins from Hubli and elsewhere in the interior, also pepper, cardamoms, cassia, and coarse blue *dungari* cloth.

[^26]: Pigeon Island.

[^27]: Cannanore.

[^28]: Ponnāni.

[^29]: i.e. ‘country of the Tamils.’

[^30]: Cranganore.

[^31]: ‘Certainly very near the modern Kottayam.’

[^32]: Porakād.

[^33]: The steady loss of specie in the Indian trade caused grave difficulties in the Roman Empire.

[^34]: ‘These were principally the beryls of the Coimbatore district, for which there was a constant demand in Rome.’—Schoff.

[^35]: Indian sailors must have known and used the monsoon much earlier than c. 45 A.D., the date of Hippalus’ discovery.
