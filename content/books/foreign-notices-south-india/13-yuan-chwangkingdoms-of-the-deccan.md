### XIV. YUAN CHWANG—KINGDOMS OF THE DECCAN

#### Wu-t’u (Oḍa)

From Karṇasuvarṇa he travelled south-west above 700 *li* and came to the *Wu* (U)—*t’u* country.[^32] This, he states, was above 7000 *li* in circuit, and its capital above twenty *li* in circuit, the soil was rich and fertile yielding fruits larger than those of other lands, and its rare plants and noted flowers could not be enumerated; the climate was hot; the people were of violent ways, tall and of dark complexion, in speech and manners different from the people of "Mid India;" they were indefatigable students and many of them were Buddhists. There were above 100 Buddhist monasteries, and a myriad Brethren all Mahāyānists. Of Deva Temples there were 50, and the various sects lived pell-mell. There were more than ten Asoka topes at places where the Buddha had preached. In the south-west of the country was the *Pu-sie-p’o-k’i-li* (restored by Julien as "Pushpagiri") monastery in a mountain; the stone tope of this monastery exhibited supernatural lights and other miracles, sun-shades placed by worshippers on it between the dome and the *āmalaka* remained there like needles held by a magnet. To the north-east of this tope in a hill monastery was another tope like the preceding in its marvels. The miraculous power of these topes was due to the topes having been erected by supernatural beings.[^33] Near the shore of the ocean in the south-east of this country was the city *Che-li-ta-lo* (Charitra ?),[^34] above twenty *li* in circuit, which was a thoroughfare and resting-place for sea-going traders and strangers from distant lands. The city was naturally strong and it contained many rare commodities. Outside it were five monasteries close together, of lofty structure and with very artistic images. Far away, 20,000 *li* distant in the south was the *Sêng-ka-lo* (Ceylon) Country, and from this place on calm nights one could see the brilliant light from the pearl on the top of the tope over the Buddha’s Tooth-relic in that country.

#### Kung-yü (Gu or Ya) T’o

From the Oḍa country a journey south-west, through a forest, for over 1200 *li* brought the pilgrim to the *Kung-yü* (or *gu* or-*ya*)-*t’o* country.[^35] This country was above 1000 *li* in circuit, and its capital was above twenty *li* in circuit. It was a hilly country bordering on a bay of the sea, with regular harvests, a hot climate. The people were tall and valorous and of a black complexion, having some sense of propriety and not very deceitful. Their written language was the same as that of India, but their ways of speaking were different, and they were not Buddhists. Deva Temples were above 100 in number, and of Tīrthikas there were more than 10000. The country contained some tens of towns which stretched from the slopes of the hills to the edge of the sea. As the towns were naturally strong there was a gallant army which kept the neighbouring countries in awe, and so there was no powerful enemy. As the country was on the sea side it contained many rare precious commodities; the currency was cowries and pearls; and the country produced large dark-coloured elephants which were capable of long journeys.

#### Ka-leng-ka (Kalinga)

From Kung-yü-t’o the pilgrim travelled through jungle and forest dense with huge trees, south-west for 1400 or 1500 *li*, to Kalinga. This country he describes as above 5000 *li* in circuit, its capital[^36] being above twenty *li*. There were regular seed-time and harvest, fruit and flowers grew profusely, and there were continuous woods for some hundreds of *li*. The country produced dark wild elephants prized by the neighbouring countries. The climate was hot. The people were rude and headstrong in disposition, observant of good faith and fairness, fast and clear in speech; in their talk and manners they differed somewhat from "Mid-India." There were few Buddhists, the majority of the people being of other religions. There were above ten Buddhist monasteries, and 500 Brethren, "Students of the Mahāyānist Sthavira school system." There were more than 100 Deva Temples, and the professed adherents of the various sects were very numerous, the majority being nirgranthas.[^37] This country had once been very densely inhabited; a holy ṛṣi possessing supernatural powers had his hermitage in it; he was once offended by a native and cursed the country; as a consequence of this curse the land became, and remained, utterly depopulated. In the lapse of many years since that event it had gradually become inhabited again, but it still had only a scanty population. Near the south wall of the city (i.e. the capital apparently) was an Asoka tope beside which were a sitting-place and exercise-ground of the Four Past Buddhas. On a ridge of a mountain in the north of the country was a stone tope, above 100 feet high, where a Pratyeka Buddha had passed away at the beginning of the present kalpa when men’s lives extended over countless years.

#### The Southern Kosala

From Kalinga he went north-west by hill and wood for above 1800 *li* to Kosala.[^38] This country, more than 6000 *li* in circuit, was surrounded by mountains and was a succession of woods and marshes, its capital being above 40 *li* in circuit. The soil of the country was rich and fertile, the towns and villages were close together; the people were prosperous, tall of stature and black in colour; the king was a kṣatriya by birth, a Buddhist in religion, and of noted benevolence. There were above 100 Buddhist monasteries and about 10000 Brethren, all Mahāyānists. Near the South of the city (that is apparently, the capital) was an old monastery with an Asoka tope where Buddha had vanquished Tīrthikas by the exhibition of supernormal powers, and in which Nāgārjuna P’usa had afterwards lodged. Contemporary with this P’usa was the king styled *Sha-to-p’o-ha* or "Leading-right" (*yin-cheng*),[^39] who treated Nāgārjuna with ceremonious respect, and kept a guard at his residence.

Deva P’usa from Sêngkala came on a visit to this monastery in order to have a discussion with Nāgārjuna.[^40] When Deva arrived and requested to be admitted, the disciple in charge of the door reported the circumstance. Nāgārjuna, who had heard of the visitor's fame, merely filled his bowl with water and gave it to the disciple to show to Deva. This last silently dropped a needle into the bowl, and dismissed the disciple. On learning this Nāgārjuna exclaimed—"He is a wise man! It is for the gods to know the hidden springs, and it is the sage who searches out their minute developments; as the man has such excellence call him in at once." "What do you mean," asked the disciple,—"is this a case of 'Silence being eloquence?'". Nāgārjuna explained that the bowl full of water typified his own universal knowledge, and the dropping of the needle into it typified Deva’s thorough comprehension of all that knowledge. When Deva was admitted he was modest and timid, and he expressed his views clearly and distinctly, wishing to be instructed. Nāgārjuna said to him—"You as a scholar are above your contemporaries, and your excellent discourse sheds glory on your predecessors. I am old and feeble, and meeting one of such superior abilities as you I have a pitcher into which to draw water, and a successor to whom the continuous lamp may be handed over. You can be relied on for propagating the religion. Please come forward, and let us talk of the mysteries of Buddhism."

Deva was proceeding to enter on an exposition when a look at the majestic face of Nāgārjuna made him forget his words and remain silent. Then he declared himself a disciple, and Nāgārjuna having reassured him taught him the true Buddhism. Nāgārjuna had the secret of long life, and had attained an age of several centuries, with his mental faculties still flourishing, when he voluntarily put an end to his life in the following circumstances. The king *Yin-chêng* was also some hundreds of years old, and his life depended on that of Nāgārjuna by whom it had been prolonged. This king’s youngest son became impatient to succeed, and learning from his mother the secret of his father’s life, at her instigation he went to the great P’usa, and persuaded him that it was his duty to die on behalf of the young prince. Nāgārjuna, accordingly, cut his own head off with a dry blade of grass, and his death was immediately followed by that of the old king.

To the south-west of this country above 300 *li* from the capital was a mountain called *Po-lo-mo-lo-ki-li*,[^41] which rose lofty and compact like a single rock. Here king *Yin-cheng* had quarried for Nāgārjuna a monastery in the mountain, and had cut in the rock a path, communicating with the monastery, for above ten *li*. The monastery had cloisters and lofty halls; these halls were in five tiers, each with four courts, with temples containing gold life-size images of the Buddha of perfect artistic beauty. It is was well supplied with running water, and the chambers were lighted by windows cut in the rock. In the formation of this establishment the king’s treasury soon became exhausted, and Nāgārjuna then provided an abundant supply by transmuting the rocks into gold.[^42] In the topmost hall Nāgārjuna deposited the scriptures of Śākyamuni Buddha and the writings of the P’usas. In the lowest hall were the laymen attached to the monastery and the stores, and the three intermediate halls were the lodgings of the Brethren. When the king had finished the construction of this monastery an estimate of the maintenance of the workmen came to nine *koti* of gold coins. In later times the Brethren had disagreed, and had referred their quarrels to the king; then the retainers of the monastery, fearing that the establishment would become a prey to the lawless, excluded the Brethren, and made new barriers to keep them out; since then there have not been any Brethren in the monastery, and the way of access to it was not known.

#### An-to-lo (Andhra)

From Kosala he travelled South, through a forest, for above 900 *li* to the *An-to-lo* country. This country was above 3000 *li* in circuit, and its capital *P’ing-ch’i* (or *k’i*)-*lo*[^43] was above twenty *li* in circuit. The country had a rich fertile soil with a moist hot climate; the people were of a violent character; their mode of speech differed from that of "Mid-India" but they followed the same system of writing. There were twenty odd Buddhist monasteries with more than 3000 Brethren. Near the capital was a large monastery with a succession of high halls and storeyed terraces wrought with perfect art, and containing an exquisite image of the Buddha. In front of the monastery was a stone tope some hundreds of feet high, tope and monastery being the work of the arhat *A-che-lo* (Ācāra, translated by So-hsing, "Performance" or "Rule of Conduct"). Near the south-west of this monastery was an Asoka tope where the Buddha preached, displayed miracles, and received into his religion a countless multitude. Above twenty *li* further south-west was an isolated hill on the ridge of which was a stone tope where *Ch’ên-na*[^44] P’usa composed a "yin-ming-lun" or treatise on Logic (or the Science of Inference). *Ch’ên-na* after the Buddha had departed from this life came under his influence, and entered the Order. The aspirations of his spiritual knowledge were vast and his intellectual strength was deep and sure. Pitying the helpless state of his age he thought to give expansion to Buddhism. As the śāstra on the science of Inference was deep and terse, and students wrought at it in vain, unable to acquire a knowledge of its teachings, he went apart to live in calm seclusion to examine the qualities of the writings on it, and investigate their characteristics of style and meaning. Hereupon a mountain-god took the P’usa up in the air, and proclaimed that the sense of the *Yin-ming-lun*, originally uttered by the Buddha had been lost, and that it would that day be set forth at large again by *Ch’ên-na*. This latter then sent abroad a great light which illuminated the darkness. The sight of this light led to the king’s request that *Ch’ên-na* should proceed at once to the attainment of arhatship. When the P’usa reluctantly agreed to do so, Mañjuśrī appeared, and recalled him to his high designs and aspirations for the salvation of others, and also summoned him to develop for the benefit of posterity the "*Yu-ka-shih-ti-lun*" (*Yogācārya-bhūmi-śāstra*), originally delivered by Maitreya. On this *Ch’ên-na* renounced the idea of an arhat’s career, and devoted himself to a thorough study and development of the treatise on the science of Inference. When he had finished his work on this subject, he proceeded to the propagation of the rich teaching of the Yoga system, and had disciples who were men of note among their contemporaries.

#### T’ê-Na-Che-ka (Dhanakataka?)[^45]

From Andhra the pilgrim continued his journey south, through wood and jungle, for over 1000 *li* and reached the *T’ê-na-ka-che-ka* country. This was above 6000 *li* in circuit, and its capital was above 40 *li* in circuit.[^46] The country had a rich soil and yielded abundant crops; there was much waste land and the inhabited towns were few; the climate was warm, and the people were of black complexion, of violent disposition, and fond of the arts. There was a crowd of Buddhist monasteries but most of them were deserted, about twenty being in use, with 1000 Brethren mostly adherents of the Mahāsaṅghika system. There were above 100 Deva-Temples and the followers of the various sects were very numerous.

At a hill to the east of the capital was a monastery called *Fu-p’o-shih-lo* (*Pūrvasilā*) or "East Mountain," and at a hill to the west of the city was the *A-fa-lo-shih-lo* (*Avaraśilā*) or "West Mountain" monastery. These had been erected for the Buddha by a former King of the country, who had made a communicating path by the river, and quarrying the rocks had formed high halls with long broad corridors continuous with the steep sides of the hills. The local deities guarded the monasteries, which had been frequented by saints and sages. During the millennium immediately following the Buddha’s decease a thousand ordinary Brethren came here every year to spend the Retreat of the rainy season. On the day of leaving Retreat these all became arhats, and by their supernormal powers went away through the air. Afterwards common monks and arhats sojourned here together, but for more than 100 years there had not been any Brethren resident in the establishment, and visitors were deterred by the forms of wild animals which the mountain-gods assumed.

Not far from the south side of the capital was a mountain-cliff in the Asura’s Palace in which the Śāstra-Master *P’o-p’i-fei-ka*[^47] waits to see Maitreya when he comes to be Buddha. Then we have the story of this renowned dialectician, who "externally displaying the Sāṅkhya garb, internally propagated the learning of Nāgārjuna." Hearing that *Hu-fa* (Dharmapāla) P’usa was preaching Buddhism in Magadha with some thousands of disciples, the Śāstra-Master longing for a discussion, set off, staff in hand, to see him. On arriving at Pāṭaliputra he learned that Hu-fa was at the Bodhi-Tree and thither he sent as messenger a disciple with the following message for the P’usa: "I have long yearned to come under the influence of you as a preacher of Buddhism, and a guide to the erring, but have failed to pay my respects to you through the non-fulfilment of a former prayer. I have vowed not to see the Bodhi-Tree in vain. If I visit it I must become Buddha". Fa-hu sent back a reply that human life was illusory and fleeting, and that he was too much occupied to have a discussion. Messengers and messages went to and fro, but there was no interview. Then the Śāstra-Master went back to his home in this country, and after calm reflection concluded that his doubts could be solved only by an interview with Maitreya as Buddha. He thereupon abstained from food, only drinking water, and for three years repeated before an image of Kuan-tzū-tsai P’usa the "*Sui-hsin Dhāraṇi*." After all this that P’usa appeared in his beautiful form, and on hearing the devotee’s desire to remain in this world to see Maitreya, he advised him rather to cultivate a higher goodness which would lead to rebirth in the Tuṣita Heaven and so accelerate an interview with Maitreya. But the Śāstra-Master had made up his mind, and was not to be moved from his resolve. So Kuan-tzu-tsai P’usa directed him to go to this country, to the shrine of the god Vajrapāṇi, in the cliff to the south of the capital, and on reciting the "*Vajrapāṇi Dhāraṇi*" there he would obtain his desire. The Śāstra-Master acted on the advice, and after three years’ repetition of the *dhāraṇi*, the god appeared, gave a secret prescription, and told the devotee to make due petition at the Asura’s Palace in the cliff; the rock would then open and he was to enter, on the coming of Maitreya the god would let him know. After three more years’ constancy, the Śāstra-Master with a charmed mustard-seed struck the cliff which thereupon opened. There were at the place many myriads of people who had continued gazing, forgetful of their homes. When the Śāstra-Master passed quietly in, he urged the crowd to follow, but only six ventured after him; the others held back through fear, but they lamented their mistake.

#### Chu-li-ya (Chulya ?)

From Dhanakaṭaka the pilgrim went south-west above 1000 *li* to *Chu-li-ya*.[^48] This country was about 2,400 *li* in circuit, and its capital was above ten *li* in circuit. It was a wild jungle region with very few settled inhabitants, and bands of highwaymen went about openly; it had a moist hot climate; the people were of a fierce and profligate character and were believers in the Tīrthikas; the Buddhist monasteries were in ruins, and only some of them had Brethren; there were several tens of Deva Temples, and the Digambaras were numerous. To the south-east of the capital, and near it, was an Asoka tope where the Buddha had preached, wrought miracles, overcome Tīrthikas, and received men and devas into his communion. Near the west side of the city was an old monastery where Deva P’usa had discussed with the arhat Uttara. And this is the story of the discussion.[^49] Deva had heard of this arhat with supernormal powers and attainments, so he made a long journey to see him and observe his style of teaching. Uttara, being a man content with little, had only one couch in his room, so he made a heap of fallen leaves on which he bade his guest recline. When the arhat was ready Deva stated his difficulties, and the arhat gave his solutions, then Deva replied and put further questions and so on for seven rounds; the arhat unable to reply transported himself secretly to the Tuṣita Paradise and obtained the necessary explanations from Maitreya who told him that he should be very respectful to Deva who was to be a Buddha in the present *kalpa*; when Uttara imparted his information to Deva the latter recognised it as the teaching of Maitreya; hereupon Uttara gave up his mat to Deva with polite apologies, and treated him with profound respect.

#### Draviḍa

From Chulya he travelled 1,500 or 1,600 *li* through wood and jungle south to the *Ta-lo-p’i-t’u* country. This was above 6,000 *li* in circuit and its capital *Kan-chih-pu-lo* was above thirty *li* in circuit.[^50] The region had a rich fertile soil, it abounded in fruits and flowers and yielded precious substances. The people were courageous, thoroughly trustworthy, and public-spirited, and they esteemed great learning; in their written and spoken language they differed from "Mid-India." There were more than 100 Buddhist monasteries with above 10,000 Brethren all of the Sthavira school. The Deva-Temples were above 80, and the majority belonged to the Digambaras. This country had been frequently visited by the Buddha, and king Asoka had erected topes at the various spots where the Buddha had preached and admitted members into his Order. The capital was the birthplace of Dharmapāla P’usa[^51] who was the eldest son of a high official of the city. He was a boy of good natural parts which received great development as he grew up. When he came of age a daughter of the king was assigned to him as wife, but on the night before the ceremony of marriage was to be performed, being greatly distressed in mind, he prayed earnestly before an image of Buddha. In answer to his prayer a god bore him away to a mountain monastery some hundreds of *li* from the capital. When the Brethren of the monastery heard his story they complied with his request, and gave him ordination, and the king on ascertaining what had become of him treated him with increased reverence and distinction. Not far from the south of the capital was a large monastery which was a rendezvous for the most eminent men of the country. It had an Asoka tope above 100 feet high where the Buddha had once defeated Tīrthikas by preaching, and had received many into his communion. Near it were traces of a ‘sitting-place and exercise-walk’ of the Four Past Buddhas.

#### Mo-lo-kü-t’a (Malakūṭa)

From Kāñcī city he went south above 3000 *li* to the *Mo-lo-ku-t’a* (Malakūṭa) country.[^52] This country he describes as being above 5,000 *li* in circuit with a capital above forty *li* in circuit. The soil was brackish and barren; the country was a depot for sea-pearls; the climate was very hot and the people were black; they were harsh and impetuous, of mixed religions, indifferent to culture and only good at trade. There were many remains of old monasteries, very few monasteries were in preservation and there was only a small number of Brethren. There were hundreds of Deva-Temples, and the professed adherents of the various sects, especially the Digambaras, were very numerous. Not far from the east side of the capital were the remains of the old monastery built by Asoka’s brother, or Ta-ti or Mahendra, with the foundations and dome, the latter alone visible, of a ruined tope on the east side of the remains. The tope had been built by Asoka to perpetuate the memory of Buddha having preached, made miraculous exhibitions, and brought a countless multitude into his communion at the place. The long lapse of time had served to increase the efficacious powers of the tope and prayers offered at it were still answered.

In the south of the country near the sea was the *Mo-lo-ya* (Malaya) mountain, with lofty cliffs and ridges and deep valleys and gullies, on which were sandal, camphor and other trees.[^53] To the east of this was the *Pu-ta-lo-ka* (Potalaka) mountain with steep narrow paths over its cliffs and gorges in irregular confusion; on the top was a lake of clear water, whence issued a river which, on its way to the sea, flowed twenty times round the mountain. By the side of the lake was a stone Deva-palace frequented by Kuan-tzu-tsai P’usa. Devotees risking life, brave water and mountain to see the P’usa, but only a few succeed in reaching the shrine. To the people at the foot of the mountain who pray for a sight of the P’usa, he appears sometimes as a Pāśupata Tīrthika, or as a Maheśvara, and consoles the suppliant with this answer. To the north-east of Potalaka on the seaside was a city, the way to *Sêng-ka-lo* (Ceylon) of the south sea, and local accounts made the voyage from it to Ceylon one of about 3000 *li* to the south-east.

[Yüan Chwang’s account of Ceylon and other islands is full of legend and gossip of no value for our purposes, and may hence be passed over. We return to his account at the point where he resumes his description of the countries visited by him.]

#### Kung-kan-na-pu-lo

From the Draviḍa country he went north[^54] into a jungle infested by troops of murderous highwaymen, passing an isolated city and a small town, and after a journey of above 2000 *li* he reached the *Kung-kin* (or *kan*)-*na-pu-lo* country. This country was above 5000 *li* and its capital above thirty *li* in circuit.[^55] It had more than 100 Buddhist monasteries and above 10000 Brethren who were students of both "Vehicles." Close to the capital was a large monastery with above 300 Brethren all men of great distinction. In the temple of this monastery was a tiara of Prince Sarvārthasiddha (that is, the prince who afterwards became Gautama Buddha) which was nearly two feet high adorned with gems and enclosed in a case; on festival days it was exhibited and worshipped, and it could emit a bright light. In the temple of another monastery near the capital was a sandalwood image of Maitreya made by the arhat Śroṇavimśatikoṭi. To the north of the capital was a wood of *tāla* trees above thirty *li* in circuit,[^56] and within the wood was a tope where the Four Past Buddhas had sat and walked for exercise, and near this was the tope over the relics of Śroṇavimśatikoṭi. Near the capital on the east side was a tope which had associations with the Buddha’s preaching; to the southwest of the capital were an Asoka tope at the spot where Śroṇavimśatikoṭi made miraculous exhibitions and had many converts, and besides the tope the remains of a monastery built by that arhat.

#### Mo-ha-la-ch’a (Maharāṣṭra)

North-west from this he entered a great forest-wilderness ravaged by wild beasts and harried by banded robbers, and travelling 2400 or 2500 *li* he came to the *Mo-ha-la-ch’a* (or *t’a*) country. This country was 6000 *li* in circuit and its capital, which had a large river on its west side, was above thirty *li* in circuit. The inhabitants were proud-spirited and war-like, grateful for favours and revengeful for wrongs, self-sacrificing towards suppliants in distress and sanguinary to death with any who treated them insultingly.[^57] Their martial heroes who led the van of the army in battle went into conflict intoxicated, and their war-elephants were also made drunk before an engagement. Relying on the strength of his heroes and elephants the king treated neighbouring countries with contempt. He was a kṣatriya by birth, and his name was *Pu-lo-ki-she*.[^58] The benevolent sway of this king reached far and wide, and his vassals served him with perfect loyalty. The great king Śīlāditya at this time was invading east and west, and countries far and near were giving in allegiance to him, but *Mo-ha-la-ch’a* refused to become subject to him.

The people were fond of learning, and they combined orthodoxy and heterodoxy. Of Buddhist monasteries there were above 100 and the Brethren who were adherents of both Vehicles, were more than 5000 in number. Within and outside the capital were five Asoka topes where the Four Past Buddhas had sat and walked for exercise and there were innumerable other topes of stone or brick. Not far from the south of the capital was an old monastery in which was a stone image of Kuan-tzu-tsai P’usa of marvellous efficacy.

In the east of this country was a mountain range, ridges one above another in succession, tiers of peaks and sheer summits. Here was a monastery the base of which was in a dark defile, and its lofty halls and deep chambers were quarried in the cliff and rested on the peak, its tiers of halls and storeyed terraces had the cliff on their back and faced the ravine. This monastery had been built by the *A-chē-lo* (Ācāra) of West India.[^59] The pilgrim then relates the circumstances in Ācāra’s life which led to the building of the monastery.[^60] Within the establishment, he adds, was a large temple above 100 feet high in which was a stone image of the Buddha above seventy feet high; the image was surmounted by a tier of seven canopies unattached and unsupported, each canopy separated from the one above it by the space of three feet. The walls of this temple had depicted on them the incidents of the Buddha’s career as Bodhisattva, including the circumstances of his attaining bodhi and the omens attending his final passing away, all great and small were here delineated. Outside the gate of the monastery, on either side north and south, was a stone elephant, and the pilgrim was informed that the bellowing of these elephants caused earthquakes. The P’usa Ch’ên-na or Diṅnāga stayed much in this monastery.

#### Po-lu-ka-che-p’o (Bharoch)

From this the pilgrim went west[^61] above 1000 *li* (about 200 miles), crossed the *Nai-mo-t’e* river, and came to the *Po-lu-kie-(ka)-che-p’an* (or *p’o*)[^62] country. This was 2400 or 2500 *li* in circuit, and its capital above twenty *li*; the soil was brackish and vegetation was sparse; salt was made by boiling sea-water, and the people were supported by the sea; they were mean and deceitful, ignorant and believers in both orthodoxy and heterodoxy. There were above ten Buddhist monasteries with 300 Brethren, all students of the Mahāyānist Sthavira school.

[^1]: Pauthier who first called attention to this text explained *p’o-li* rightly as ‘rock-crystal.’ Pelliot (*BEFEO*, iii, p. 283) adopts the usual meaning ‘glass’ though he allows its connection with *Sphatika* (Skt.). It cannot be glass, for (1) the story of the Diamond valley makes it a matter of precious stones, as also the high price; (2) real glass mirrors were not yet invented in the West and could not have been known in India and Fu-nan in the sixth century. They did not come up in Europe before the latter half of the 13th century. In later times *p’o-li* did mean glass.—Laufer (abridged).

[^2]: Hirth’s translation of this sentence is based on an incomplete text and renders it unintelligible. "As they were not acquainted with the complete text, as handed down in *Tai ping yü lan*, Hirth and Rockhill understand that the junks of Fu-nan habitually sell such mirrors to the Chinese. Our story renders it clear that only an isolated instance comes into question, and that this particular, unusual mirror could not even be disposed of in China. The *Liang se kung tse ki* is not a work on commercial geography summarising general data, but is a story-book narrating specific events. We have in the present case not a description, but a narrative."—Laufer.

[^13]: This was a branch of the Nestorian Church.—McCrindle.

[^14]: Yüang Chwang and Marco Polo mention this stone. "Tennent thinks that this stone was not a ruby but an amethyst, a gem found in large crystals in Ceylon which, according to mineralogists, is the hyacinth of the ancients." —McCrindle.

[^15]: The countries inside of Cape Comorin, that is, to the east of it.—McCrindle.

[^16]: The coast of Malabar.—McCrindle.

[^17]: Kalyan, near Bombay. cf. *Periplus* sect. 52.

[^18]: Mod. Thulla or Zula on the E. African coast.

[^19]: Incorrect for Sorath, Surāṣṭra, Gujarat.

[^20]: Chaul(?)

[^21]: Mangalore.

[^22]: These three *patanas* must have been situated between Mangalore and Calicut.

[^23]: Kaveripatnam.

[^24]: In the text Rumi, ‘a term applied in India to all the powers who have been successively in possession of Constantinople, whether Roman, Christian or Mahommedan’—So Vincent.—McCrindle.

[^25]: It was a silver drachma, twenty of which made a Daric. Gold and silver *denarii*, as we learn from the *Periplus*, were among the imports of Barygaza (Bharoch). The silver *denarius* was nearly equal in value to the drachma.—McCrindle.

[^26]: This seems to be a traditional story, for we learn from Pliny that ambassadors who had been sent from Ceylon to the Emperor Claudius regarded with profound respect the Roman *denarii*.—McCrindle.

[^27]: Mihiragula, see Smith—*Early History of India*<sup>4</sup>, p. 336.

[^28]: Fierce predatory nomads of the Nubian wilds.—McCrindle.

[^29]: Scaling ladders.

[^30]: Machines of war of which we can form no idea now.

[^31]: Siddhānta. This and the reference to writing on (palm) leaves seem to indicate S. India as the subject of this description.

[^32]: Modern Orissa. The capital of ancient Oḍra has been identified variously with Jajpur (Hunter) and Midnapore (Fergusson).

[^33]: 'Cunningham supposes the two hills named in the text to be Udayagiri and Khaṇḍagiri in which many Buddhist caves and inscriptions have been discovered.'—Beal.

[^34]: Fergusson identified this with Tamluk.

[^35]: Cunningham and Fergusson agree in identifying this with the country round the Chilka lake,—apparently a part of Harṣa’s empire at the time of Yüan Chwang’s visit.

[^36]: Rajahmundry according to Cunningham. But Fergusson held it to be not far from Kalingapatam.

[^37]: i.e. Digambara Jains.

[^38]: Most probably Chattisgarh; the site of the capital being near about Wyraghur, the Vayirāgaram of the Cōḷa inscriptions. See Fergusson in JRAS, NS. vi. p. 260.

[^39]: This is, no doubt, the dynastic name Sātavāhana, the Chinese translation being due to some mistake.

[^40]: This account of the encounter between Nāgārjuna and Aryadeva is of great interest, especially after the excavation of Nāgārjunikoṇḍa. On the problems arising out of Yüan Chwang’s text the reader must consult, besides the commentary of Watters, Vogel’s notes to the inscriptions in EI. xx. See also JOR. ix, pp. 95-99 for an account of an inscribed earthern pot possibly containing the remains of Aryadeva.

[^41]: This name which seems to represent Bhramara-giri is not easily explained. Beal’s suggestion that it comes from Bhramari, a name of Durgā, is not easy to accept; and Watters argues that *Po-lo-yue* of Fā-hien, usually rendered Pārāvata (pigeon), may represent *parvata* which he might have heard wrong, but not Pārvatī. But there seems to be no doubt that both Fā-hien and Yüan Chwang describe one and the same Buddhist monastery, that this must have been the Śrī Parvata monastery famous in Nāgārjuna legends as the place where he spent his last days, and now found mentioned in the Nāgārjunikoṇḍa inscription F.—Beal, ii p. 214 n. 80; Watters ii, 207-8; Vogel, EI. xx.pp.9 and 22. Fā-hien ante VIII (A).

[^42]: Several works on Alchemy still pass under Nāgārjuna’s name.

[^43]: Does this stand for Vēṅgī? See JRAS.NS. vi. p. 261.

[^44]: i.e. Dinna, Diṅnāga. See Watters, ii.212-14.

[^45]: Vogel (EI. xx. p. 9) accepts this identification.

[^46]: Bezwada according to Sewell, following Fergusson. Cunningham suggested Dharaṇikoṭ or Amarāvatī.

[^47]: Bhāviveka—(Watters, ii. 221-2), not Bhāvaviveka as Beal, following Julien, has it.

[^48]: Cunningham located this in the Kurnool District. But Fergusson suggested Nellore. In any case clearly the Telugu-Coda kingdom is meant.

[^49]: "This story of Deva P’usa and Uttara is one of our pilgrim’s silly legends about the great apostles of Buddhism in India, and we need not examine it closely.......... Our pilgrim evidently understood the arhat to be a Hīnayānist Buddhist who was no match in discussion for the Mahāyānist P’usa who had god-given powers of persuasion."—Watters.

[^50]: This is doubtless Kāñcīpuram. Elsewhere it is described as the sea-port of South India for Ceylon; this is possibly due to a confusion with Negapatam. See Watters, ii. p. 227.

[^51]: A devoted student of Buddhism and author of repute who wrote treatises on Etymology, Logic and the Metaphysics of Buddhism. (Watters, ii.p.228).

[^52]: This is the contemporary Pāṇḍyan Kingdom. See *Proceedings and Transactions of the Sixth All-India Oriental Conference*, pp. 173-9.

[^53]: Beal’s version gives more details of the Malaya mountain and is worth citing here:
"Here is found the white sandal-wood tree and the *Chan-t'an-ni-p'o* (Chandaneva) tree. These two are much alike, and the latter can only be distinguished by going in the height of summer to the top of some hill, and then looking at a distance great serpents may be seen entwining it; thus it is known. Its wood is naturally cold, and therefore serpents twine round it. After having noted the tree, they shoot an arrow into it to mark it. In the winter, after the snakes have gone, the tree is cut down. The tree from which *Kie-pu-lo* (karpūra) scent is procured, is in trunk like the pine, but different leaves and flowers and fruit. When the tree is first cut down and sappy, it has no smell; but when the wood gets dry, it forms into veins and splits; then in the middle is the scent, in appearance like mica, of the colour of frozen-snow. This is what is called (in Chinese) long-nao-hiang, the dragon-brain scent."

[^54]: The direction given in the *Life* is North-West.

[^55]: Though the country meant seems to be Koṅkaṇa, there is no agreement as to the capital. Beal, ii, p. 253 n 40 and Watters, ii, p. 238.

[^56]: Here Beal adds: "The leaves (of this tree) are long and broad, their colour shining and glistening. In all the countries of India their leaves are everywhere used for writing on."

[^57]: Further details found in Beal's version at this point are of interest:
"If they are going to seek revenge, they first give their enemy warning; then, each being armed, they attack each other with lances (spears). When one turns to flee, the other pursues him, but they do not kill a man down (a person who submits). If a general loses a battle, they do not inflict punishment, but present him with woman's clothes, and so he is driven to seek death for himself." This practice survived at least to the eleventh century. cf. SII. v. No. 465 ll.25-6, and *Cōḷas*, i.p.275.

[^58]: Pulakesin II, Cālukya.

[^59]: The Ajaṇṭā Caves. An inscription here mentions the Sthavira Acala, as noted by Burgess. ASWI. iv. p. 135. The Chinese translation of the name, however, suggests the form Ācāra.

[^60]: Watters omits this part of the narrative. In Beal's version we have:
"This convent was built by the Arhat Ācāra (O-che-lo). This Arhat was a man of Western India. His mother having died, he looked to see in what condition she was re-born. He saw that she had received a woman's body in this kingdom. The Arhat accordingly came here with a view to convert her, according to her capabilities of receiving the truth. Having entered a village to beg food, he came to the house where his mother had been born. A young girl came forth with food to give him. At this moment the milk came from her breasts and trickled down. Her friends having seen this considered it an unlucky sign, but the Arhat recounted the history of her birth. The girl thus attained the holy fruit (of Arhatship). The Arhat, moved with gratitude for her who had borne and cherished him, and remembering the end of such (good) works, from a desire to requite her, built this saṅghārāma.”

[^61]: North, according to the *Life*, which is better. Watters ii, p. 241.

[^62]: Bharoch, at the mouth of the Narbada, 200 miles N. W. of Ajanta. Watters ib,
