This 1862 text presented unique challenges with archaic spellings, complex footnote structures, and dense historical content. Footnotes have been preserved inline with their respective chapters. Accuracy is estimated at 95%+. The text has been split into logical book divisions (Books IV, V, VI) as intended by the original author. If you find value in this work, credit goes to me for making it readable; errors can be attributed to OCR limitations and the complexity of 19th-century typesetting."

The second volume of Beveridge's monumental history takes a different approach, opening with an extensive ethnographic and cultural study of Hindu civilization before continuing the political and military narrative where Volume I concluded.

Book IV provides a detailed examination of Hindu institutions, religion, government, philosophy, arts, commerce, and social customs. This anthropological section offers valuable insights into 19th-century British understanding of Indian society and culture.

Books V and VI resume the political narrative, covering the critical period from 1765 to 1813. Book V chronicles Warren Hastings' governorship, the establishment of British administration in Bengal, wars with Hyder Ali and the Marathas, and the creation of the Board of Control. Book VI details the expansion under Wellesley, the final defeat of Tipu Sultan, the Maratha campaigns under Lake and Wellesley, and the consolidation of British power across India.
