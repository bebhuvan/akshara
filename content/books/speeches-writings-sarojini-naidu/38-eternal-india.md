## ETERNAL INDIA

**TO M. K. GANDHI.**

*The following poem was contributed by Mrs. Sarojini Naidu to the "Young India":*

Thou whose unaging eyes have gazed upon
The Vision of Time's glory and decay,
Round thee have flower-like centuries rolled away
Into the silence of primeval dawn,
Thou hast out-lived Earth's empires and outshone
The fabled grace and grandeur of their sway,
The far-famed rivals of thine yesterday,
Iran and Egypt, Greece and Babylon,
Sealed in Tomorrow's vast abysmal womb
What do thy grave prophetic eyes foresee
Of swift or strange world-destiny and doom?
What sudden kingdoms that shall rise and fall,
While thou dost still survive, surpass them all,
Secure, supreme in ageless ecstasy?
