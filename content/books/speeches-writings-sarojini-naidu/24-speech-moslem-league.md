## SPEECH AT THE MOSLEM LEAGUE.

*Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, at the request of the President on behalf of the delegates, in supporting the Resolution on "Self-Government" at the Conference of the All-India Moslem League at Lucknow, in December, 1916, said:—*

I do not know what claim I have to stand before you to-day except that I have been for many years a faithful comrade of the young generation of the Mussalmans and champion of the Women of the Muslim community and fought with their men-folk for the privilege that Islam gave long ago but which you denied to your women-folk. I stand before you to-day to support this great cause of Self-Government for India. I remember the occasion nearly four years ago, that historic occasion on which the young generation of Islam passed a new constitution and brought within the range of practical politics to be realised by effective measures and cooperation with the Hindu community this great dream—it seemed far off dream — Self-Government or the Government of the people by the people, the investment of power into the hands of the people. On this occasion as I look around me I miss two friends who were sincere friends of this ideal of Self-Government. One is the late Pandit Bishan Narayan Dhar. I also miss to-day with intense and passionate sense of loss the magnetic presence of my friend and your great leader, Muhamad Ali. (*Loud applause*) I should like also to mention the valuable services rendered to your community by Wazir Hasan the tireless Secretary of your League. One who was keen as a distinguished visitor and a sympathetic critic four years ago, is to-day guiding the deliberations of your League for the greater glory of India. 

In the Hon. Mr. Jinnah you have a President who stands as a focus between Hindus and Mussalmans and it is so because Muhamad Ali persuaded him to become a member of the League. During the last few days we have been suffused with enthusiasm, and the most enthusiastic response of the united people has been given to the Indian Nation in their demand for Self-Government. We all recognise this indomitable determination to go up with the demand for Self-Government; and the scheme the Post-war Reforms would not have been possible but for the fact that we millions in India speak with one voice, because we are one, undivided and indivisible whole. I am not a politician. I spoke to you as a lover of my country and I charge you, Mussalmans of India, to remember the high responsibilities of your desires. No one can give to you what you do not have capacity to take.
