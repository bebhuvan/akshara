## HINDUS AND MUSSALMANS.

*Mrs. Sarojini Naidu wrote as follows to Mr. G. A. Natesan, the Editor of the "Indian Review," before she left Hyderabad for England in June, 1913: —*

One request I should like to make of you as an editor and leader of Indian opinion. I feel we have come to a very critical time in our history and that a great responsibility lies with those who are in the position of our leaders. You have realised that the Mussalmans have definitely held out their hand to the Hindus. Be gracious, be wise, be brave and make the Hindus to hold out their hand to the Mussalmans at the next Congress. Do not analyse motives too closely, but take the proffered hand and hold it fast, and so represent truly the Indian world as far as your influence reaches — and, I believe, it reaches far. I am going away a very sick person — as I believe my illness is of a serious nature, and I may be away in Europe for a year — but this is the request I am making to all my friends who lead public opinion.
