## AWAKE!


*The following verses were recited at the Indian National Congress, at Bombay, in December, 1915.*

Waken, O mother! thy children implore thee,
Who kneel in thy presence to serve and adore thee !
The night is aflush with a dream of the
morrow,
Why still dost thou sleep in thy bondage
of sorrow ?
Awaken and sever the woes that enthral us,
And hallow our hands for the triumphs
that call us !

Are we not thine, O Belov'd, to inherit
The manifold pride and power of thy spirit?
Ne'er shall we fail thee, forsake thee or falter,
Whose hearts are thy home and thy shield
and thine altar,

Lo ! we would thrill the high stars with
thy story,
And set thee again in the forefront of
glory.

Hindus: —Mother ! the flowers of our worship
have crowned thee !
Parsees: —Mother ! the flame of our hope
shall surround thee !
Mussulmans: —Mother ! the sword of our
love shall defend thee !
Christians: —Mother ! the song of our faith
shall attend thee !
All Creeds: —Shall not our dauntless devotion
avail thee ? Hearken ! O queen and
O goddess, we hail thee !
