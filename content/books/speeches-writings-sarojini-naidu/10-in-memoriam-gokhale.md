## IN MEMORIUM: GOKHALE.

*In sending this touching tribute to the memory of the late Mr. Gokhale, Mrs. Sarojini Naidu wrote to the Editor of the "*Indian Social Reformer*", Bombay:*

"*They are appearing under Gokhale's portrait in Mr. Wacha's forthcoming brochure on the great man: but I should like them first to appear in the 'Social Reformer'*."

Heroic heart! lost hope of all our days!
Need'st thou the homage of our love or
    praise?
Lo! let the mournful millions round thy
    pyre
Kindle their souls with consecrated fire
Caught from the brave torch fallen from
    thy hand,
To succour and to save our stricken
    land;
And in a daily worship taught by thee
Upbuild the Temple of her Unity.
