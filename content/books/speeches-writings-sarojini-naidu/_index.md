Sarojini Naidu (1879-1949), known as the "Nightingale of India," was a poet, political activist, and one of the most prominent figures in India's struggle for independence. This collection, first published in 1918, brings together her most significant speeches and writings on subjects ranging from women's education and social reform to Hindu-Muslim unity and self-governance.

As Edmund Gosse wrote: "She is the most brilliant, the most original, as well as the most correct, of all the natives of Hindusthan who have written in English." These addresses reveal not only her literary brilliance but also her passionate commitment to India's freedom and social transformation.

The speeches span from 1902 to 1917, capturing a pivotal period in Indian history when the seeds of independence were being sown through the efforts of leaders like Gokhale, Gandhi, and Naidu herself.
