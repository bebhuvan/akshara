## INDIA'S GIFTS.

*Mrs. Sarojini Naidu indited the following
verses for the Report of the Hyderabad
Ladies' War Relief Association, Dec. 1915:*

Is there aught you need that my hands
    withhold,
Rich gifts of raiment or grain or gold ?
Lo ! I have flung to the East and West
Priceless treasures torn from my breast ?
And yielded the sons of my stricken womb
To the drum beats of duty, the sabres of
    doom.

Gathered like pearls in their alien graves
Silent they sleep by the Persian waves,
Scattered like shells on Egyptian sands,
They lie with pale brows and brave, broken hands,
They are strewn like blossoms mown down by chance
On the blood-brown meadows of Flanders
    and France.

Can ye measure the grief of the tears I weep
Or compass the woe of the watch I keep?
Or the pride that thrills thro' my heart's despair,
And the hope that comforts the anguish of
   prayer?
And the far sad and glorious vision I see
Of the torn red banners of Victory?

When the terror and tumult of hate shall cease
And life be refashioned on anvils of peace,
And your love shall offer memorial thanks
To the comrades who fought in your dauntless ranks,
And you honour the deeds of the deathless
   ones
Remember the blood of thy martyred sons!
