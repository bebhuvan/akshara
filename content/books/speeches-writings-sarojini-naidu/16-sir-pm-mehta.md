## SIR R M. MEHTA.

*At a memorial meeting held in Bai Perozebai Hall, Secunderabad, on November 28th, 1915, Mrs. Sarojini Naidu who was in the chair said: —*

They were met to mourn the loss of a great man and that, if proof were wanted at any time as to the unanimity of feeling at the loss, it could be judged from the list of names on the programme representing all races and creeds which would emphasize that India was no longer a geographical expression. He was a great figure in the Bombay Presidency and represented the vitality of the nation. To some he was a Parsi, but to others he was an Indian figure, proud to be an Indian, never afraid of popular displeasure or censure. He was not exactly what some called him the apostle of righteousness, but was the one man who laid his life at the altar of his Motherland. 

His one great lesson to India was his indomitable courage. He was made of the stuff that would die, but not yield, when he said: "I stand to represent the country's honour." He was loyal to his friends, generous to his foes, and a zealous citizen.

*Mrs. Sarojini Naidu in conclusion said he was a prince of the country and of intellect, and continued: —*

Who can sufficiently extol the sweetness of the man and that invincible sense of chivalry? Who will sum up the tenderness of his heart that made him the champion of women? Who will sum up his chivalry, the grace of head and heart that was so rarely combined in him? He was the golden link between the experience of the older and the enthusiasm of the younger generation.
