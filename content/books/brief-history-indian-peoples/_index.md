A comprehensive survey of Indian history written by one of the foremost authorities on India in the late 19th century. Sir William Wilson Hunter's work stands out for its balanced approach, giving proper weight to India's ancient civilizations and Hindu kingdoms rather than merely presenting India as a conquered territory. 

The book covers the geographical foundations of India, the aboriginal peoples and Aryan settlers, the development of Buddhism and Hinduism, Greek and Scythian invasions, the Mughal dynasty, Maratha power, European settlements, and the establishment of British rule through the Sepoy Mutiny and beyond. With detailed chapters on early civilizations, religious movements, and political transformations, this work remains a classic introduction to Indian history.
