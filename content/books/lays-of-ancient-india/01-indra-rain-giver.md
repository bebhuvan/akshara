## INDRA, THE RAIN-GIVER.

“Vritra is supposed to confine the waters, and will not let them descend until the sky-god or rain-god, Indra, strikes the monster with his thunderbolt. The captive waters then descend in copious showers, rivers rise almost instantaneously, and gods and men rejoice over the changed face of nature.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. p. 79.

### 1.

I SING the lay, our fathers knew,—
How Indra mighty Vritra slew!
He pierced the rain-cloud in his might,
And gave us water, copious, bright!
The joyous mountain streams rolled swiftly by,
For Indra cleared for them the rocky way!

### 2.

He pierced the rain-cloud, stout of heart,
And Tvashtri forged the lightning’s dart!
The grateful showers in torrents fell,
And joyous streamlets roar and swell!
And as the milch-kine hasten to their young,
Unto the sea the streamlets speed along!

### 3.

Impetuous like a bull in might,
Indra, eager for the fight,
Thrice drank the Soma;—in his hand
Grasped the forkéd lightning brand!
He pierced the foremost rain-cloud in his might,
And poured the joyous waters, sparkling bright!

### 4.

Mighty god and warrior proud!
You smote the demon of the cloud,
You quelled his power, destroyed his wile,
And cleared the earth from darkness vile!
Bright was the sky again with ruddy dawn,
And joyful mortals hailed the rising sun!

### 5.

In gloomy folds did Vritra proud
The earth and sky in darkness shroud
But with the lightning’s fiery might
Great Indra pierced him in the fight!
Like a tall forest tree by woodmen felled,
Proud Vritra lies prostrate, by Indra killed!

### 6.

Did not Vritra, proud, elate,
Proudly challenge Indra great?
The mighty Indra, in his ire,
Has dealt on him his vengeance dire!
Splashing on the rivers Vritra fell,
How roar the whirling eddies, how they swell!

### 7.

With severed limbs, in mighty rage
The combat still did Vritra wage.
Once more the lightning flashed its fire,
On Vritra’s neck fell in its ire.
The weak in vain will try the hero’s might,
And vain was Vritra’s war with Indra bright!

### 8.

Glad waters over Vritra roll,
As rivers over banks that fall.
Erst strong in might and strong in gloom,
He kept the waters in his womb.
How lies that demon, mighty in his fall!
Spurning the dead, how glad the waters roll!

### 9.

But darker clouds come in their might,
And Indra fights a fiercer fight!
Once more the forked lightnings fly,
Once more the clouds prostrated lie!
Low as a cow beside her calf is laid,
The mother rain-cloud lies with Vritra dead!

### 10.

O’er the dead the waters hie,
Sparkling as they ceaseless fly!
Low lies the nameless shapeless dead,
Bright roll the streams by torrents fed!
Then sing great Indra’s praise with mighty breath,
For Indra’s foe now sleeps the sleep of death!

### 11.

When light was prisoned by dark gloom,
’Twas Indra won her from its womb!
When rain was prisoned by the cloud,
’Twas Indra slew the demon proud!
Then sing great Indra’s praise in mighty strain,
For Indra gave us light and gave us rain!

### 12.

Vain were Vritra’s darts and blows,
For Indra shields himself from foes!
Vain was Pani’s wily art,
The cows were won from Bilu’s fort.[^1]
Then sing great Indra’s praise in mighty song,
He rolled the seven great rivers fierce and strong.[^2]

### 13.

The lightning shafts that Ahi[^3] sent,
On Indra harmless all were spent;
And Ahi’s thunders, gusts of rain,
Against the mighty god were vain!
And vain were Ahi’s stratagems and arts,
For Indra rent them with his piercing darts!

### 14.

Great Indra! In that dubious war
Didst thou own a secret fear?
Did thy arm, for conquests made,
Await some other warrior’s aid?
Or didst thou, like the swooping bird of prey,
O’er ninety streams and nine flee far away?

### 15.

Lightning-arméd! Mighty king
Of living and of lifeless thing!
The glorious monarch lives on high,
And sends us bright rain from the sky.
And as the spokes are circled by the rim,
Great Indra holds the universe in Him!

*Rig Veda*, I. 32.
