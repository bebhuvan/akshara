## INDRA, THE SUPREME DEITY.

### 1.

MORTALS! Did you question me,
Who is Indra, where is he?
He who is Celestial Light!
Leadeth gods and men in might!
He whose power pervades the earth and sky,
Mortals! He is Indra, rules on high!

### 2.

He who fixed the solid earth,
Shaped the mountains at their birth!
He whose mighty hand hath bent
The far extending firmament!
He who shaped the ever glorious sky,
Mortals! He is Indra, rules on high!

### 3.

He who pierced the clouds in might,
Rolled the seven great rivers bright!
He who quelled the demon gloom,
Conquered light from its dark womb!
He, in clouds who hurls the lightning bright,
Mortals! He is Indra, victor in the fight!

### 4.

Listen, mortals! to my verse,
His handiwork—this universe!
He has quelled the stubborn foe,
Banished him to live in woe!
He wrests the Dâsa’s treasures from his hold,[^4]
For he is Indra! hunter strong and bold!

### 5.

Have you, doubting, questioned me,
Where is Indra, who is he?
Mortals! In your impious thought
Have you whispered, He is not!
Dread the great punisher and his vengeance dire!
For Indra smites the impious in his ire!

### 6.

But his ceaseless mercies seek
The pious man, the poor and meek!
Gracious King! a crown he wears,
And listens to our hymns and prayers!
With grateful hearts libations pour to him,
For he is Indra, Lord of ancient fame!

### 7.

His the kine and steeds of war,
The village home, the battle car!
His arm lifts up the radiant sun,
And opes the ruddy gates of dawn!
His lightning shaft the darksome rain-cloud rends,
For he is Indra, copious rain who sends!

### 8.

Contending hosts repeat his name,
And chiefs invoke the Lord of fame!
Car-borne warriors shout his praise,
And trembling nations sing his praise!
Mortals! Unto him is worship due,
For he is Indra, whom our fathers knew!

### 9.

Man triumphs not but by his blade,
And warring nations ask his aid!
The universe he measures right,
And rolling worlds confess his might!
He sees th’ eternal mountains wear away,
For Indra knows no death, no slow decay!

### 10.

He who killed with lightning dire
Impious nations in his ire;
He whose blessings never rain
Upon the boastful and the vain;
He who crushed the Dâsas in his might,
He is Indra! victor in the fight!

### 11.

He who mighty warriors quelled,
In forty years Samvara felled;
He who struck the demon cloud,
Rent his vast and gloomy shroud;
He who strikes the impious in his might,
He is Indra! glorious in the fight!

### 12.

His seven bright tints bedeck the bow,
His seven great rivers joyous flow!
His lightning laid Rauhina low,
The heaven-aspiring, impious foe!
He who strikes the impious in his might,
He is Indra! conqueror in the fight!

### 13.

The earth and sky to Indra pray,
And trembling hills obeisance pay!
To Indra, wielder of the dart,
Libations pour and lift your heart!
The God of mighty strength and lightning hand,
He is Indra! wielder of the brand!

### 14.

Lift your heart and lift your praise,
Pour libations, chant his lays!
For hymns and gifts to him are dear,
And Indra guards us from all fear!
And he accepts our gifts and listens to our lays,
Mortals! He is Indra! Shout his praise!

### 15.

Great Indra! mortals raise thy song,
For thee their pious rites prolong,
From thee all gifts and blessings flow,
And thou art Truth! To thee we bow!
Grant us, great King! for bountiful thou art,
Sons, brave in war, and pious in their heart!

*Rig Veda*, II. 12.
