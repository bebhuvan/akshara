## TEN PRECEPTS FROM DHAMMAPADA.

“The whole of the *Dhammapada* is a string of 423 moral precepts which for their beauty and moral worth are unsurpassed by any similar collection of precepts made in any age or country. . . . Who is not struck by the remarkable coincidence of these noble precepts with those preached five hundred years after in Palestine by the gentle and pure-souled Jesus Christ?”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. p. 366, 367.

*Return Love for Hatred.*

Hate for hatred if ye render,
Hatred lives and mortal strife;
Love return for bitter hatred,
Hatred dies, and sweet is life! (5)

*Precepts without Acts.*

Pious precepts, gentle friend,
Never acted, wisely meant,
Are like gay and coloured flowers,—
Without fragrance, without scent! (51)

*The Golden Rule.*

As you dread all pain and suffering,
Love your life and death abhor,
So doth every living creature,
Harm not things that live and breathe.
(129, 130)

*Live without Hatred among Men you Hate.*

With the men who live in hatred
Ye shall live devoid of hate,
Unto men who smite in anger
Show your love and meekness great. (197)

*Good Works survive.*

Good works done endure for ever,
And in higher life will meet,
E’en as gentle loving kinsmen
Home-returning kinsmen greet! (200)

*Overcome Anger by Love.*

Anger by your love o’ermaster,
Good for evil acts return;
By charity the miser conquer,
By your truth let false men learn! (223)

*The Faults of other Men.*

Faults of other men ye question,
Not the fault that ye have done!
Like chaff your neighbour’s vices winnow,
Like a false die hide your own! (252)

*The Elder and the Sage.*

Not an Elder, not a Sage,
Is the man advanced in age;
Truth and virtue, love and pureness,
Make the Elder and the Sage. (260, 261)

*Assumed and True Holiness.*

Not by skins and plaited hair,
Not by family or birth,
But by truth and righteousness
Is the Brâhman known on earth. (393)

*There is Ravening within.*

Wherefore wear the plaited hair,
Wherefore garment wild of skin,
What avails this outward penance
When there’s ravening within! (394)
