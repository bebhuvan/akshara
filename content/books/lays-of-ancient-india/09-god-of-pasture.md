## THE GOD OF PASTURE.

“Pûshan is the sun as viewed by shepherds in their wanderings in quest of fresh pasture-lands. He travels in a chariot yoked with goats, guides men and cattle in their travels and migrations, and knows and protects the flocks. The hymns to Pûshan, therefore, often breathe a simplicity which is truly pastoral.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. pp. 84, 85.

### 1.

PÛSHAN! radiant god of day!
Lead us o’er the dangerous way.
Vanquish every hurtful foe,
Free our path from every woe,
Child of the Clouds! Oh lead us evermore,—
We follow,—as our fathers did before!

### 2.

Smite the skulking robber vile,
Lurking in the dark defile;
Smite the murderer and the thief
Who wait in stealth to take our life.
Remove the wily foes who lurk before,
And Pûshan! lead us safe for evermore![^15]

### 3.

Thou the pathless waste dost know,
And Pûshan! thou canst quell the foe!
Thou didst lead our fathers right
In their wanderings, Pûshan bright!
Then lead us, radiant god! for evermore,—
We follow,—as our fathers did before!

### 4.

And thou hast treasures manifold,
Radiant weapons, arms of gold,
Foremost of the sons of light,
Bounteous leader, Pûshan bright!
Grant us wealth from thy unfailing store,
And we will praise thy bounty evermore!

### 5.

Lead us safely in thy might,
Where the wily foemen wait;
Lead us over pleasant ways,
Help us with thy bounteous grace.
Oh! lead us, Pûshan, in this trackless shore,
And lead us, radiant god! for evermore!

### 6.

Where the grass is rich and green,
Where the pasture’s beauteous seen,
Lead us over such pleasant way,
Chase all ills and woes away!
Oh! lead us, Pûshan! in this trackless shore,
And lead us, radiant god! for evermore!

### 7.

Grant us blessings rich and good,
Fill our homes with plenteous food;
Grant us pastures far and near,
Make us, Pûshan! strong in war!
Oh! lead us, Pûshan! in this trackless shore,
And lead us, radiant god! for evermore!

### 8.

We lift our hearts and sing his praise,
To Pûshan chant our pious lays,
And from the good and gracious god
We ask for wealth and ask for food.
Oh! lead us, Pûshan! in this trackless shore,
And lead us, radiant god! for evermore!

*Rig Veda*, I. 42.
