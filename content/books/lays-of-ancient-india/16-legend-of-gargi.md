## THE LEGEND OF GÂRGÎ.

### 1.

JANAKA, the holy monarch,
Erst in wide Videha[^4] reigned,
Made a mighty sacrifice,
And an ample feast ordained!
Brâhmans from the Kuru kingdom
And from broad Panchâla[^5] came,
For they knew Janaka’s bounty,
And they heard Janaka’s fame.

### 2.

Who of these assembled Brâhmans,
To the sacrifice who came,
Is the wisest,—deepest learned,
Worthiest of a Brâhman’s name?
Such the thought that stirred the bosom
Of Janaka, monarch bold,
And he penned a thousand milch kine,
On each horn was hung some gold!

### 3.

“Saintly teachers, learned Brâhmans!
Welcome to my sacrifice!
Whoso of you be the wisest
Let him stand and win the prize!
Who is deepest in his lore,
Let him take the cows and gold,”
Thus unto the learned Brâhmans
Spoke Janaka, monarch bold!

### 4.

Brâhmans heard the royal mandate,
Durst not stand and claim the prize,
Where so many wise had gathered,
Who could claim to be most wise?
Up stood noble Yâjnavalkya,—
Janaka’s great priest was he,—
Boldly spake unto his pupil,
“Drive the cattle home for me!”

### 5.

Wrathful were the other Brâhmans,—
Asvala, th’ invoking priest,
Ârtabhâga, wise and saintly,
Lâhyâyani, great at feast,
Châkrâyana, Kaushîtaki,
Uddâlaka full of pride,
Many other wrathful sages
Yâjnavalkya’s knowledge tried!

### 6.

Proudly stood great Yâjnavalkya,
Answered them with haughty pride,
As a great and towering mountain
Beateth back the surging tide!
Then stood Gârgî, saintly lady,
Noble hearted, fair and tall,
Learned as the wisest Brâhman,
Noblest in th’ assembled hall!

### 7.

“As a warrior of the Kâsîs
Or Videha’s warlike land
Lifts his bow with sound of thunder,
Lifts two arrows in his hand,
Even so, great Yâjnavalkya,
In this hall I challenge thee,
I will ask you but two questions,
Listen then and answer me.”

### 8.

“On the earth, so far-extending,
In the firmament and sky,
In the present, past, and future,
Ever present, ever nigh,
Like the warp and like the woof
Woven in the space and sky,—
Wherein rests this universe,—
What is present, ever nigh?”

### 9.

To her answered Yâjnavalkya,
“Deep the question thou hast made!
It is ether, noble lady,
Which doth sky and earth pervade.”
To him spake the noble lady,
“Good the answer you have given!
But this ether, Yâjnavalkya,
Wherein is it subtly woven?”

### 10.

“Listen, Gârgî, to my answer,
In th’ IMMORTAL it is woven!
Of th’ IMMORTAL who shall speak?
Listen, as in *sâstras*[^6] given.
Not corporeal and not ether,
He is neither short nor long,
Flames not like the flaming red fire,
Nor like water flows along.

### 11.

“Without shadow, without darkness,
He is neither air nor sky,
Void of sensuous taste and feeling,
Dwells alone sublime and high!

Without organs, without senses,

All the world He hears and sees,

Void of limbs, but ever active,

Void of form, but measureless !

### 12.

“ Gargi ! wouldst then further fathom?

His great arm holds earth and sky!

Days and hours His mandates listen,

Sun and moon His bests obey!

He has shaped the snowy mountains,

Rolled the rivers swift and broad,

He directs all nature’s actions,

He is Brahman, He is God ! ”

Abridged from Brihadâranyaka Upanishad, III. 6, 8.*
