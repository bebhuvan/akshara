## THE CREATOR.

This hymn consists of nine verses. Only the first three are given below in translation. They explain the sublime idea that all the different gods are only the different names of the One God, that all the powers of Nature are the manifestations of the One Power.

### 1.

OUR Father at creation’s birth
Made the sky and made the earth.
The broad earth mingled with the sky,
In watery form they both did lie.
His mighty hand the heavens then lifted high,
And stretched the limits of the earth and sky.

### 2.

The All-Creator, He is great,
He shaped all things in every state,
Above all creatures,—mighty King,—
He sees and holds up everything.
Higher than where the stars of Great Bear shine,—
Great King of all!—a loftier seat is Thine!

### 3.

He our Father! He our King!
Whose hand created everything,
Whose world-pervading eye surveys
The world’s far limits,—ends of space!
The names of many gods and powers He bears,
But He is One! To Him ascend our prayers!

*Rig Veda*, X. 82.

[^1]: “The rays of light are compared to cattle which have been stolen by the powers of darkness, and *Indra* (the Sky) seeks for them in vain. He sends *Saramâ* (the Dawn) after them, and Saramâ finds out the *Bilu* or fortress where the *Panis* or powers of darkness have concealed the cattle. The Panis try to tempt Saramâ, but in vain. Saramâ comes back to Indra, and Indra marches with his forces, destroys the fort, and recovers the cattle; the darkness is gone, and it is day. . . . Professor Max Müller maintains that the story of the siege of Troy is a development of this simple Vedic myth. . . . Ilium, according to him, is Bilu, the cave or the fortress of the Rig Veda. Paris is the Panis of the Veda who tempt, and Helena is the Vedic Saramâ who resists the temptation in the Veda, but succumbs to it in Greek mythology.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. p. 80.

[^2]: The Indus, its five tributaries, and the Sarasvati.

[^3]: Another name of Vritra, or the rain-cloud.

[^4]: Indra is supposed to help the Aryan Hindu conquerors in their wars with the *Dâsas* or the aborigines of India.

[^5]: “The word used in the text is Riksha, which may either mean *stars* generally, or the stars of the constellation Great Bear. The root *rich* means to shine, whence in course of time the word Riksha came to have two meanings—the shining stars of a particular constellation, and an animal with bright eyes and shining glossy hair. By a natural confusion of ideas, the constellation itself ultimately came to be called the Bear. The question is discussed with remarkable eloquence and learning by Max Müller in his ‘Science of Language,’ and he explains that ‘the surprise with which many a thoughtful observer has looked at these seven bright stars, wondering why they were ever called the Bear, is removed by reference to the early annals of human speech.’”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. p. 77.

[^6]: The poet Sunahsepa is supposed to be bound to the sacrificial post, and prays to Varuna to remove his chains and to pardon his sins.

[^7]: The word used in the text is Aditi, the parent of the bright gods. “Aditi means the undivided, the unlimited, the eternal. It is in reality, as has been stated, the earliest name invented by man to express the Infinite—the visible infinite, the endless expanse, beyond the earth, beyond the clouds, beyond the sky. . . . It means, according to the eminent German scholar, Dr. Roth, the eternal and inviolable principle, the celestial light.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. p. 83.

[^8]: *Devo Aryo* in the original text.

[^9]: “As no sacrifice could be performed without fire, Agni, or Fire, was called the invoker of the gods.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. p. 85.

[^10]: Kanva is a Vedic poet. His son is supposed to have composed this hymn. The practice of repeating the names of holy and charitable men early in the morning still obtains in India.

[^11]: “There is much confusion in the Rig Veda as to who the Âdityas are—the sons of this Celestial Light (Aditi). In II. 27, Aryaman and Bhaga and Daksha and Ansa are named, besides Varuna and Mitra. . . . When in course of time the year was divided into twelve months, the number of the Âdityas was fixed at twelve, and they were the suns of the twelve months.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. pp. 83, 84.

[^12]: *Kshetrapati* literally means the Lord of the field.

[^13]: Sîra and Suna are gods of agriculture,—the Sun and Air according to Yâska.

[^14]: “The furrow, Sîtâ, is addressed as a female, and asked to yield copious harvests. In the Yajur Veda also, the furrow is similarly worshipped. And when the Aryans gradually conquered the whole of India, and primeval jungles and waste lands were marked with the furrow, the furrow, or Sîtâ, assumed a more definite human character, and became the heroine of the Epic which describes the Aryan conquest of Southern India.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. pp. 35, 36.

[^15]: The third and fourth verses are almost a repetition of what precedes, and have been omitted in the translation.

[^16]: One verse after this has been omitted. It is full of proper names and obscure allusions.

[^17]: *I.e.*, the Angirasas, a celebrated priestly house.

[^18]: Sacrificial grass.

[^19]: All celebrated ancient priestly houses.

[^20]: There are eight more verses in the original, which have not been translated.

[^21]: The Hindu scriptures, like those of other nations, hold that in the beginning water pervaded the universe.
