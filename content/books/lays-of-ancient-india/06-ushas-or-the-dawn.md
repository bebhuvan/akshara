## USHAS, OR THE DAWN.

“There is no lovelier conception in the Rig Veda than that of the Dawn. There are no hymns in the Veda more truly poetical than those dedicated to her, and nothing more charming is to be found in the lyrical poetry of any ancient nation. . . . The Dawn was known by various names, and most of these names, and the legends connected with them, were brought by the Hindus from their original abode, since we find phonetical equivalents of these names, and a repetition of some of the legends too, in Greek mythology. Ushas is the Eos of the Greeks and the Aurora of the Latins. Arjunî, according to philologists, is the Greek Argynoris, Brisayâ is Briseis, and Dahanâ is Daphne. Saramâ is phonetically equivalent to the Greek Helena. Saranyu, the mother of Yama and of the Asvins, is the Greek Erinyas, and Ahanâ is the renowned goddess Athena.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. p. 91.

### 1.

BEAUTEOUS daughter of the sky!
Hold thy ruddy light on high!
Grant us wealth and grant us day,
Bring us food with morning’s ray!
White-robed goddess of the morning sky!
Bring us light,—let night’s deep shadows fly!

### 2.

Rich in cattle, rich in steed,
With thy gifts to mortals speed!
Joyous nations welcome thee,
For thy gifts are ever free.
Speak, goddess! words of comfort and of joy,
And grant us wealth and bliss without alloy.

### 3.

Our fathers hailed thy glorious light,—
We hail thee, goddess, ever bright!
Like ships by merchants sent to sea,
Thy radiant chariot bringeth thee!
Come then, goddess! in thy glittering car,
Come and bring thy joyous light from far!

### 4.

And men of lore will raise their song,
The morning hymns to thee belong!
Kanva sings his pious lays
To thy soft resplendent rays.
Kanva, wisest of the men of lore,
Proclaims their names who feed and bless the poor![^10]

### 5.

Come like a housewife gentle-hearted,
Tending all!—For night’s departed.
Grant another joyous day
To beasts that walk and birds that fly.
And men and beasts will to their work repair,
And birds with joyous notes will fill the air!

### 6.

The strong man to his work you send,
Unto the poor your favours lend;
Soft is thy fresh and ruddy ray,
And ah! too fleeting is thy stay!
Hasten, then, and we to work repair,
And birds with joyous notes will fill the air!

### 7.

She comes! she comes! in her bright car
Scattering splendour from afar!
From regions far above the sun
In hundred chariots comes the Dawn!
She comes! she comes! in radiant loveliness,
She comes! she comes! to heal us and to bless!

### 8.

Mortals in devotion bend,
Hymns and shouts of joy they send!
For she comes with ruddy rays,
And she comes to heal and bless!
She brings us gifts in her resplendent car,
Removes our wants and drives our foes afar!

### 9.

Beautous daughter of the sky!
Spread thy ruddy light on high!
Day by day, in morning bright,
Bring us blessings with your light!
Bring us gifts in thy resplendent car,
And drive the shades of gloomy night afar!

### 10.

Ruddy daughter of the sky!
Our life, our work, is all in thee!
For thou dispell’st the gloomy night,
And thou art day, resplendent bright!
Thou hear’st our hymns and prayers from afar,
And bring’st us gifts in thy resplendent car!

### 11.

White-robed daughter of the sky!
Our wine and cakes we offer thee!
Our joyous hymns to thee ascend,
To thee in worship mortals bend.
Grant that their pious rites from harm be free,
Grant that their pious hearts may turn to thee!

### 12.

Glorious daughter of the sky!
Bring with thee the gods from high!
Grant us milch-kine, grant us steed,
And our rites with blessings speed!
Grant us food and wealth and mighty name,
Grant us strength and health and warrior’s fame!

### 13.

Blushing daughter of the sky!
Spread thy radiance far and nigh!
Vanquish foemen in the fight,
Perish all their power and might!
Grant us, radiant goddess! food and health,
Grant us strength in arms and copious wealth.

### 14.

Gracious daughter of the sky!
Our fathers in the days gone by
For thy blessings ever prayed,
For thy gifts, auspicious maid!
And we too lift our hearts and hymns to thee,
Accept our joyous songs and pious lay!

### 15.

Wide ope the portals of the sky!
Light comes in and shadows fly!
Wide and far thy blessings shower,
Save us with thy healing power!
Wide be our homes and free from harm and woe,
Rich be our flocks, our crops in plenty grow!

### 16.

Nymph of radiant loveliness!
Grant us food and grant us bliss!
Grant us cattle, wealth and fame,
And a warrior’s mighty name!
Grant us, goddess! safety from all woe,
For thou art good,—from thee all blessings flow!

*Rig Veda*, I. 48.
