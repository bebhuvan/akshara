## BUDDHA’S BIRTH.

### 1.

WHEN was born our saintly Master,
Asita the Rishi found
Gods in all the sky assembled,
Wafting blessings, pleased in mind!
“Wherefore are they all assembled,
Wave their garments in the sky?
Wherefore,” asked the mighty Rishi,
“Pleased in mind the gods on high?”
“’Tis because the saintly Master
For the good of all is born,
He is born among the Sâkyas,[^1]
Fair Lumbini doth adorn!”

### 2.

Asita, the mighty Rishi,
Went unto the Sâkya king,
“Unto thee a babe is given,—
I to him my homage bring!”
They brought the babe, like gold resplendent,
Wrought and shaped by skilful hand,
Beaming with an inward glory,
Jewel of the blessed land!
“He is the auspicious Master,”
So the sage Asita said,
“He will be the great awakened,
Rule of righteousness will spread.”

### 3.

And the blind received their sight,
Longing for the babe to see!
And the deaf they heard again,
Heard his words of piety!
And the dumb they spoke again
Of the saintly Master come!
And the crooked men were straight,
Walked forth free the halt and lame!
Chains and shackles broke and fell
In the prisons of the earth!
And the blue and joyous sky
Hailed the saintly Master’s birth!
