## BOOK V.

## THE HIMALAYAS.

THE towering Himalaya rose,
Surpassing mighty Meru high,
To view the limits of wide space,
Perchance to scale the lofty sky!

Eternal sunshine on his face,
His back in ceaseless gloomy night,
Like Siva in dark tusker-skin,
His face with radiant smiles all bright!

Dwellers of earth and sky and heaven
Mutually unseen here dwell;
This range, itself a perfect world,
Displaying Sambhu’s mighty skill!

All white the heaven-kissing peaks,
With glittering gold the plateaus streaked,
And bright as autumn’s fleecy clouds
With golden glittering lightning decked!

Like peopled towns the mountain plateaus
Streaked with gems which silk-like beam,
And creeper grots by nymphs frequented
Which like sylvan dwellings seem!

Aloft, the rainless, sparkless clouds,
In white and fleecy masses piled,
Are like the mountain’s giant wings,
Far-extending, vast and wild! (6)

Wild tuskers gore the rocky banks,
Which many a costly mine conceal;
And sacred rills their waters pour,
Which every pious wish fulfil!

And mountain gems shine with a ray,
As of the soft-hued crimson flower,
And shed o’er plateaus, streaked with gold,
The chastened light of evening hour!

Untold Kadambas grace the scene,
The Tamal lends its cooling shade,
In priceless gems the peaks are rich,
The vales with beauteous creepers blessed;

Wild torrents flow through flowery banks,
And trees are with wild blossoms graced!
And mountain nymphs bedecked in gold
Oft frolic in the sparkling rills;

And Nâgas, fond of trees and creepers,
Love to dwell in wooded hills.
And fleecy clouds with rainbow graced
Oft rest the gem-decked peaks around,

And seem like snowy mountain peaks
Until ye hear the thunder’s sound! (12)

Sweet-voiced ducks and lilies grace
Pure Mânasa! thy waters cool,
Where Umâ often meets her lord,
Begirt by troops, but calm in soul!

And oft his worshippers recall
Tripurâ burnt by Siva’s ire,
When lighting planets in the sky
Flames forth at night the forest fire!

And rolling down from mighty plateaus,
Spreading in a mass of spray,
And winding through deep rocky gorges,
Gangâ shines like Châmar[^17] gay!

And Arjun’s mind was struck with wonder
At this great, this glorious sight;
And unto him thus spoke the Yaksha,
Words appropriate, soft and sweet. (16)

“Sacred range! whose snow-white turrets
Pierce the lofty vault of heaven,
Sinful mortals view these mountains,
And their sins are all forgiven!

“Its deeper parts like Brahmâ’s Self,
In sacred Sâstras faintly told,
Are unto mortals all unknown,—
The outer ranges they behold!

“Here creeper grots are rich in flowers,
And lucid lakes in lilies blown;
And haughty nymphs, wooed by their swains,
A sweet and soft emotion own!

“And aye, this mountain fills the earth
With wealth above all worlds, I ween,
And mortals by Kuvera’s gift[^18]
Their dearest wishes here obtain!

“The wealth of all the worlds combined
The sacred Himalay excels,
For here in grace and power divine
Great Sambhu with his Umâ dwells!

“Who freed from sins and mortal life
Seek Brahmâ’s holy mansion pure,
They seek it here in contemplation,
As in Sâstra’s sacred lore! (22)

“Oft in these vales celestial footprints,
Garlands cast away and pale,
And beds of flowers in sweet disorder,
Tales of secret love they tell!

“And on these hills by worlds adored
The plant at night its flame gives forth,[^19]
As glory shines on virtuous kings
Attained by might and pious worth!

“And in the groves which bend with flowers
His lay the sweet-voiced Kokil trills,
And tuskers feed on watery plants
Beside the cool and shaded rills!

“And oft they rub their scented heads
Upon the gnarléd forest tree,
The mango scent excites the Kokil,
And attracts the maddened bee!

“Beside these sweetly sounding rills
Celestial maidens often rove,
And drink the drink of gods,—the nectar,
Which the gods and Nâgas love!

“And as they rest in creeper grots,
And soft the gentle breeze sweeps by,
Faint with love’s toil, they feel its charm,
Nor seek their homes in upper sky! (28)

“Here sweet-eyed Umâ sought her lord,
By rites and penance duly made;
And Siva here in love’s sweet tremor
Clasped the blushing mountain maid!

“Gods and Asurs, for the nectar,
Erst with Mandâr churned the sea,[^20]
Bearing still the serpent’s trail,
Here Mandâr scales the lofty sky:

“And crystal rocks in masses piled
Reflect the red sun’s radiant beams,
And chastened by the sapphires blue
The day like softer moonlight seems.

“And on the ripples of the lake,
As sweet as woman’s flashing eye,
The lotus bud is gently moved
By gentle zephyrs from the sky! (32)

“When sweet-eyed Umâ gave her hand
To Siva by these mountain lakes,
Her hand was twined with sacred grass,
And Siva’s hand was twined with snakes!

“And crystal rocks with sunbeams lit
Sent forth a bright and dazzling ray,
And heightened more the light of sun
And beautified the sacred day!

“And on Kailâsa’s lofty peak,
Round which revolves th’ unwearied sun,
To please great Siva, lord of hosts,
Kuvera built his beauteous town!

“There sparkling rays of crystal rocks
In brilliant tints harmonious blend,
And to the eye of the beholder
Strange delusions often lend!

“Eternal verdure decks the fields,
The soft green woods enchant the view,
And trees with blossoms ever crowned
Nor fade nor wear the yellow hue!

“The emerald’s rays, like fresh green grass,
Deceive and tempt the forest deer,
And the pollen from the blossoms,
Wafted from the flowering trees,

“Like a golden canopy
Floats upon the evening breeze! (39)

“Oft at early dawn are seen
Unequal footprints by the rills,
For Umâ with the mighty Siva
Loves to haunt these sacred hills!

“And oft at noon, through leafy trees,
The day-god’s struggling, radiant beam
Strikes on the bright and crystal rock,
And makes it like a mirror gleam!

“And oft at night, on distant peaks,
Great Siva’s snow-white bull is seen,
And wondering females gaze and ask,
Is it the full-orbed rising moon?

“What though the rainbow’s broken arch
On fleecy clouds is faint and pale,
Borrowing fulness from the gems
It bends sublime o’er rock and vale!

“What though the gloom in moonless nights
O’ershadows valley, hill and lea,
The moon on Siva’s ample crest
Pours forth a light on flower and tree! (44)

“Yonder hill with golden caverns
Is to mighty Indra dear;
How its peaks with golden lustre
Woods and spreading forests cheer!

“And oft when mountain breezes blow,
And move luxuriant creepers thick,
The golden beams of that bright hill
Even like the flashing lightning break!

“Celestial tuskers range that hill,
And shake the scented Chandan tree;[^21]
Before their might all earthly creatures
In their terror turn and flee!

“And sapphires here with azure tints
Make soft the sun’s effulgent ray;
And darksome clouds in glorious masses
Temper here the light of day! (48)

“There Kshatriya-like thy penance do,
As by the saintly Vyâsa told;—
By noble efforts, constant toil,
Achieve their fame the great and bold!

“May Siva grant thee strength and might,
Bestow on thee his blessed grace;
And be the gods thy constant help,
And bless thy labours with success!”

Thus spoke, and hied unto his home
The Yaksha, gentle, kind, and good;
And Arjun pensive saw him part,
And for a moment sorrowing stood. (51)

He reached the hill, uncrossed by living wight,
With luscious fruits and blossoms on its height;
And as he gazed upon the lofty hill,
Great thoughts of noble deeds his heart did fill! (52)
