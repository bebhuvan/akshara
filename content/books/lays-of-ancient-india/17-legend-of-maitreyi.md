## THE LEGEND OF MAITREYÎ.

### 1.

UNTO her,—his spouse beloved,—
Maitreyî the pious-hearted,—
Thus spoke learned Yâjnavalkya,
When to woods the saint departed.
“Maitreyî, my spouse beloved,
All my wealth and goods I leave,
Take thy own, thy proper portion,
Hers to Kâtyâyanî give!”

### 2.

“Will thy wealth and worldly objects,”—
Spake the pious-hearted wife,—
“Lead me to salvation holy,
Lead me to immortal life?”
“Nay,” said learned Yâjnavalkya,
“Not unto immortal life,
But to life the rich man liveth
Wealth will lead thee, gentle wife.”

### 3.

“Vain to me the things that perish,
Lead not to immortal life,—
That which leads to true salvation,
Grant that wealth unto your wife!”
“Ever dear,” said Yâjnavalkya,
“Dearer now thou art to me,
And the wealth which brings salvation,
I will grant that wealth to thee!

### 4.

“Saintly love of man and woman,
Love unto our brother men,
Love of parents, love of children,
Love unto our flocks and kine,
Love of every earthly object
Is but love of our own Soul,
Know thy Self, and love thy Self,
Thou knowest all, thou lovest all!

### 5.

“Sound the drum, a music issues,—
Canst thou grasp that music bold?
Blow the conch at festive season,
Its wild music canst thou hold?
Strike the deep and sounding lyre,
Canst thou grasp its voice profound?
But hold the drum, the conch, the lyre,
And you stop the uttered sound!

### 6.

“Love thy great and inner Self,
Know the one, the mighty Soul,
And thou lov’st the universe,
And in sooth thou knowest all!
From the fire a deep cloud issues,
Various-formed it floats on high,—
From the mighty Soul thus issues
Forms that people earth and sky!

### 7.

“He breathed forth the universe!
Vedas, Sâstras, all are His!
Senses and the inner souls,
Worlds, the mountains, and the seas!
Seest thou this transparent crystal?
Like this, without form is He!
He breathed forth this universe!
And the worlds will in Him be!”

### 8.

“My love! my lord!” Maitreyî said,
“Pardon, if I somewhat fail,—
Weak is woman’s sense and reason,—
And obscure the truth you tell.”
“Not so,” Yâjnavalkya answered,
“Not obscure, but clear to all,—
Clear as is the sun of midday
Is that great immortal Soul!

### 9.

“Not from outer world distinct,—
Pervading all, embracing all,—
Is that one directing force,
Is that universal Soul!
Unseen, but ever manifest
In the worlds and oceans broad,
Ever present, knowing all,
He is Brahman! He is God!”

*Abridged from Brihadâranyaka Upanishad, IV. 5.*
