## SAVITRI, OR THE SUN.

“Sûrya and Savitri are the most common names of the sun in the Rig Veda, the former word answering to the Greek Helios, the Latin Sol, and the Iranian Khorshed. Commentators draw a distinction between Savitri, the rising or the unrisen sun, and Sûrya, the bright sun of the day.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. p. 84.

The following three verses are taken from a somewhat long hymn. The first of these verses is the famous *Gayatri*, the morning prayer of the Brahmans. It has a deep significance, and pious worshippers in invoking the sun invoke the Higher Power whose radiance and glory are outwardly manifested in the sun.

### 1.

SAVITRI! effulgent, bright!
Who fosters every pious rite,
Savitri! whose ruddy rays
Invite our holy hymns and lays,
With humble hearts we contemplate his rays,
And faintly see our God in his bright face!

### 2.

Savitri will bring us food,
And Bhaga, bounteous and good.[^11]
Savitri will hear our lays,
And Bhaga listens to our praise.
The radiant gods will bring us food and wealth,
And shield us from all harm, and grant us health.

### 3.

Let our pious men of lore
In our rites libations pour,
Let them in their wisdom raise
Holy hymns and songs of praise
For Savitri! Our god, our friend thou art!
And we will greet thee with a pious heart!

*Rig Veda*, III. 62.
