## VARUNA, THE GOD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.

### 1.

IN boundless radiance is his birth,
He holds the spacious sky and earth,
The heaven’s blue vault he lifts on high,
And spreads the stars across the sky!
And the broad earth, so boundless and so grand,
It is the work, Varuna! of thy hand!

### 2.

Shall I with my humble prayer
Before this mighty God appear?
Will he in his mercy take
The gifts a mortal dares to make?
With mind from sins and impure passions free,
Oh when shall I his radiant visage see?

### 3.

With anxious thought to thee I turn,
Teach me, Lord! that I may learn,
What mighty sin pollutes my heart,
And racks me with a cruel smart?
I’ve questioned men of lore to know the way,
And they have told me, Lord! to turn to thee!

### 4.

Teach me, Lord! what sin unknown
Hath its shadow o’er me thrown?
Wilt thou in thy anger smite
Thy worshipper, O Lord of light?
Teach me, Lord! to expiate my sin,
Teach me, Lord! to turn to thee again!

### 5.

Gracious Monarch! make us freed
From the sins our fathers did;
Help to expiate and shun
Unholy acts that we have done!
Like tethered cattle, or like trembling thief,
I tremble, Lord! But thou canst save my life!

### 6.

Error often leads to sin,
Wine and anger lead to ruin,
Dice and gambling to distress,
And folly to unrighteousness!
The elder oft the younger will mislead,
And even our dreams unholy thoughts will breed!

### 7.

Then save me, Lord! for thou canst save,
Protect thy worshipper, thy slave.
Freed from sin, and strong in mind,
I’ll serve Varuna, ever kind!
Grant us, Aryan[^8] God! light on our path,
And grant us strength, for we are weak in faith!

### 8.

Accept, Varuna! in thy grace,
These humble but these pious lays,
And may it ever pleasing be
The hymn we humbly sing to thee!
And may thy worshippers, with virtue blest,
Find bliss in everything, and peace and rest!

*Rig Veda*, VII. 86.
