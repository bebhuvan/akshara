## THE PENANCE OF UMÂ.

Umâ, in the extract given before from the Kena Upanishad, is divine intelligence, explaining to the celestial powers the nature of Brahman or God. In later times, however, she acquired a more distinct personality, and was considered to be the daughter of the god of the Himâlayas, and the consort of Siva or Sambhu, one of the Hindu Trinity. Her marriage with Siva is the subject of the beautiful poem of Kâlidâsa from which the following portion has been translated.

### 1.

LONG through sultry Summer evenings
Did her mighty penance last,
Long through Rains and through the Autumn,
In the Dews and Winter’s blast.

### 2.

And when Spring the green woods mantled[^1]
With its verdure soft and green,
To the hermitage a Brâhman
Came, attired in barks and skin.

### 3.

And in language sweet and courteous
Questioned Umâ of her rite,
Asked her of her plants and creepers,
Asked her of the rills so bright.

### 4.

“Not by Gangâ’s holy waters
Are these sacred mountains graced,
Umâ! as by righteous actions,
By thy holy penance blest!

### 5.

“But a doubt in me ariseth,
Pardon if too far I go,—
Brâhmans are by nature curious,
Seek for hidden thoughts to know.

### 6.

“Thou art born of noble parents,
Decked with world-surpassing beauty!
In thy youth and in thy splendour
Why this penance,—this sad duty?

### 7.

“Noble ladies, stung with sorrow,
Oft engage in pious rite,—
In thy father’s happy mansions,
Can grief touch thee, maiden bright?

### 8.

“Wherefore leaves and barks of wild trees
Dim thy blooming beauty bright?
Does the morning’s paler glamour
Suit the moonlit starry night?

### 9.

“Not for joys of heaven this penance,
For this realm is like the sky;
And for worthy noble suitor
Need a beauteous maiden sigh?

### 10.

“Yet that sigh, that heaving bosom
Tells of disappointed love!
To a maiden of thy beauty
Can a suitor cruel prove?

### 11.

“Can he heartless view that beauty
By the red sun tinged and shaded?
Can he view thy toil-worn visage
Like moon’s crescent pale and faded?

### 12.

“But, perchance, my gentle Umâ,
Of some service I may be,
I have done some holy penance,
Thine its fruit and blessings be!”

### 13.

Silent Umâ dropped a tear-drop,
Told her maid the tale to tell,
And the maid unto the Brâhman
Told the sad and piteous tale.

### 14.

“List, O youth! The pious maiden,
Spurning all the gods of sky,
Lifts her heart, with love so tender,
To great Sambhu, lord on high!

### 15.

“In her father’s glorious mansions
Found the maid no peace, no rest,
In the cool and snow-decked grottoes
Ever burnt with love her breast!

### 16.

“Oft in midnight’s lonely silence
Weeping, she of Sambhu sung,
Till the nymphs of woods and mountains
Wept to hear her plaintive song!

### 17.

“And when came the dreary morning,
Starting from a loving dream,
Umâ clasped the empty shadow,
Called for Sambhu in a scream!

### 18.

“Brooding on her luckless passion,
She has left her father’s home,
To engage in mighty penance,
In this wilderness to roam!”

### 19.

Smiling answered then the Brâhman,
“Is it true, my lovely maid,
All this penance pure and holy
That unlovely god to wed?

### 20.

“Will thy hand so soft and tender
Clasp his hands where snakes entwine?
Will thy rich and bridal garment
On his red skins beauteous shine?

### 21.

“Wilt thou with such bridegroom wander
Over funeral sites unblest?
With the impure funeral ashes
Wilt thou stain thy gentle breast?

### 22.

“Obscure his birth! Unknown his wealth!
Unworthy he of thy bright grace!
On holy sites, not funeral places,
Pious men their altars raise!”

### 23.

Angry Umâ heard the Brâhman
Speaking thus of Sambhu high;
Her red lips quivered in her anger,
Shone her dark and flashing eye!

### 24.

“Little knowest of great Sambhu,”
Thus the angry maid replied;
“Lofty souls of unknown splendour
Flippant mortals will deride!

### 25.

“Mighty Refuge of Creation!—
Will he seek for paltry gain?
Arbiter of other’s fortunes!—
Doth he reck what is his own?

### 26.

“Wandering in dark funeral places,—
Yet of worlds the Lord is he!
Wearing shape, sublime, terrific,—
Yet he showers his blessings free!

### 27.

“Unknown his birth! For mighty Brahmâ
Does he know of Sambhu’s birth?
Unknown his power! For gods celestial,
Do they know of Sambhu’s worth?

### 28.

“But cease these words,—and, learned Brâhman!
Leave me, and in peace depart!
If small his virtues, great his failings,—
Sambhu still doth fill this heart!”

### 29.

Uprose the maiden in her anger,
Rose and quickly turned away;
But the Brâhman held her garment,
Boldly stopped the maiden’s way.

### 30.

She turned to chide,—it was her Sambhu,—
Now in glorious form divine!
“Won by love and won by penance,
Gentle Umâ! I am thine!”
