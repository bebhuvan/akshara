## A BRIDAL HYMN.

The last six verses of this long hymn have been translated. They are a part of the marriage ritual of the ancient times, and will interest modern readers.

### 1.

[*To the Bride and Bridegroom*:]

HAPPY man and beauteous bride!
Be this place your home of pride,
Loving man and duteous wife!
In peaceful union pass your life.
May prattling children fill your home with peace,
And lisping babes their grandsire’s bliss increase!

### 2.

[*The Bride and Bridegroom say*:]

The Lord on us his gifts bestow,
And happy children round us grow!
In peaceful union pass our life,
Loving man and duteous wife!

[*To the Bride*:]

In thy new home auspicious life be thine!
Be good unto our men and to our kine!

### 3.

[*To the Bride*:]

Serve thy lord with love and sweetness,
Be thy soft eyes full of brightness,
Be thy beauty ever bright,
Be thy temper ever sweet!
Bear warlike sons! and worship gods divine!
Be good unto our men and to our kine!

### 4.

[*Prayer to Indra*:]

In thy mercy, in thy grace,
Grant her wealth and happiness!
A duteous housewife in her love,
May she happy mother prove!
And may ten warlike sons to her be born,
And from her spouse her heart may never turn!

### 5.

[*To the Bride*:]

A gentle kindness ever bear
To your husband’s parents dear;
Bring within your loving rule
His sisters and his brothers all;
With queenly grace extend your gentle reign,
Be good unto our cattle and to men!

### 6.

[*The Bride and Bridegroom say*:]

All the gods who live above
May they blend our hearts in love,
May each bright celestial power
Bless us in this nuptial hour!
May they link us in a holy bliss,
And fill our peaceful home with happiness!

*Rig Veda*, X. 85.
