## HYMN OF THE DYING MAN.

The following remarkable verses are to be uttered on the death-bed. They are the last three verses of the Upanishad from which they are translated.

### 1.

SOLE Rishi! Pûshan! glorious Yama![^9]
God of day! withdraw thy rays,
And let me once more view thy splendour,—
View it with my closing eyes!
Let me once more view the light,
The gladsome light that dwells in thee!
Th’ Almighty Light which you reflect,—
Th’ Almighty Soul, it dwells in me!

### 2.

My breath will mingle with the air,
To ashes turn this mortal frame,
Then turn, my soul, recall each deed,
Each action done of praise or blame.
My hours of life are almost past,
And steals o’er me the hand of death,
Then think, my soul, of actions done,
Ere yet I yield this fleeting breath!

### 3.

Agni! friend of dying mortals,[^10]
Lead me by the righteous path,
Let me win thy gracious blessings,
Let me shun thy mighty wrath!
Lead me by the righteous path,
In this last momentous hour,
Reverently I bend to Agni,
In him—worship Brahman’s power!

*From the Îsâ Upanishad.*

[^1]: Latin translation of the Upanishads.

[^2]: It is necessary perhaps to note for our readers’ information that Brahman with a short *a* means the Universal Being, and Brâhman with a long *â* is a worshipper of that Being, *i.e.*, a man of the priestly caste.

[^3]: The fuel is required for the rite of *initiating* a boy in the Vedas and the sacred learning of old.

[^4]: Tirhoot, or North Behar.

[^5]: The Panchâla kingdom extended along the Ganges, round about the site of modern Kanouj. The Kuru kingdom extended higher up the same river, and also westwards, including the site of modern Delhi. These kingdoms flourished B.C. 1400 to 1000.

[^6]: Holy works.

[^7]: All these countries were in the Gangetic valley, and flourished about 1400 to 1000 B.C. The Usinara and the Matsya countries were to the west, lying along the Jumna river. Of the Kuru and Panchâla kingdoms I have spoken before. The Videhas lived in North Behar, and the Kâsîs in the country round the site of modern Benares.

[^8]: “While the priestly caste was still multiplying rituals and supplying dogmatic explanations for each rite, the royal caste seems to have felt some impatience at this priestly pedantry. Thinking and earnest Kshatriyas asked themselves if these rites and dogmas were all that religion could teach. Learned Kshatriyas, while still conforming to the rites laid down by priests, gave a start to healthier speculations, and inquired about the destination of the Soul and the nature of the Supreme Being. So bold, so healthy and vigorous were these new and earnest speculations, that the priestly classes, who were wise in their own esteem, at last felt their inferiority, and came to Kshatriyas to learn something of the wisdom of the new school.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. pp. 133, 134.

[^9]: All names of the sun.

[^10]: Address to Fire,—in reference to the rite of cremation, which is considered beneficial to the departed.
