## MESSAGE TO HIS PEOPLE.

### 1.

THUS speaks royal Piyadasi,[^1]
Of the gods beloved,
To his many subject nations,
Peoples he has loved:—
I have carved on rocks and pillars
Rules my men obey,
And my Dharma-mahâmâtras[^2]
Point to them the way.

### 2.

Royal highways in my empire
Are by mangoes shaded,
Wells and inns refresh and cheer
The thirsty and the jaded.
But a mission greater, holier,—
To refresh the soul!
To relieve the thirsty heart,
And comfort bring to all!

### 3.

Amongst my men of every sect,
Amongst the Brâhmans holy,
Amongst all sects of mendicants,
Amongst Nirgranthas[^3] lowly,
My Mahâmâtras ever work
For holy righteousness,
They work to show the pious way,
To show the path of peace!

### 4.

Would’st thou know that pious way,
That righteous path of peace,—
It is the way that leads to joy,
To joy and holy bliss!
Religion!—’tis another name
For Truth and Charity,
Religious rite and sacrifice
Is Kindness, Purity!

### 5.

Some would spread Religious faith
By strong compulsive laws,—
Gentle lessons and persuasion,
Be still Asoka’s ways!
I value inward inspiration,—
Awakening of the heart,—
Not a formal blind compliance
With rules that we impart.

### 6.

With this view this righteous edict
This year[^4] I promulgate,
May it teach my sons and grandsons
And my people great!
May it unto after ages
Like sun and moon endure,
May it in this life, and after,
Righteous bliss secure!

*From Pillar Edict, VIII.*
