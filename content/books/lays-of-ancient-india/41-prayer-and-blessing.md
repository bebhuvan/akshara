## BOOK XII.

## PRAYER AND BLESSING.

WITH wonder struck the hero views
The Lord of hosts in ashes smeared;
He views the crescent in his locks,
And bows before the God revered!

Himself he finds in armour clad,
And in its case the falchion bright!
Clouds pour forth a gentle rain,
Skies send heavenly blossoms fair,

And a gentle heavenly music
Floats upon the fragrant air!
And the gods by Indra bidden
Gather in their realm on high,

And their chariots gem-bespangled
Are like bright stars in the sky!
Heavenly swans with tinkling bells,
Attendants on the gods on high,

With their softly waving plumage
Gently sail across the sky!
His purpose done, his wish obtained,
Low, low, his forehead Arjun laid,

And unto the God of gods
Thus in humble accents prayed. (6)

### 1.

“The world’s Asylum! Lord of grace!
Whom men by worship may attain,
Saints by Thy grace have conquered death,
And showed the path to gods and men!

### 2.

“Who seeks Thee not in loving worship
Is a prey to sin and death!
A prey to fleeting world’s illusions,
Mortals shun his hated breath!

### 3.

“Who seeks Thee with a loving worship,
Shunning world’s deceitful ways,
He finds in Thee his true salvation,
Lord of Mercy! ’Tis Thy grace!

### 4.

“Some seek for pleasures on this earth,
Some strive for heavenly joys and bliss,
But holy refuge there is none
Save Thee! O Lord of holiness!

### 5.

“Who seeks Thee, finds his haven shore,
Who shuns Thee, walks the downward path,
For this is Law! ’Tis not Thy anger,
Thou art Mercy, void of wrath!

### 6.

“We love Thee with a tainted love,
Thy form of grace we may not know,
But even thus Thy worship, Lord!
Salvation brings to us below.

### 7.

“Illusions mock our mortal eyes,
Our actions like a shadow flee!
Who views but Thee beholds the truth,
His acts are true who trusts in Thee!

### 8.

“Saintly teachers on this earth
They teach us precepts good and great;
Thou alone, with mighty grace,
From earthly bonds can liberate!

### 9.

“To liberate this troubled earth
From sin’s tornado, passion’s storm,
Thou wearest forms unto our eyes,—
For Thou art Mercy,—void of form!

### 10.

“Thou art death and Thou art life,
The universe lives in Thy laws;
Thou salvation of the pure,
Of mighty causes Thou FIRST CAUSE!”

Thus the good and pious Arjun
Did great Sambhu’s blessings crave;
Sambhu to the pious hero
Heavenly arms and blessings gave.

And the lore by Siva given,
Radiant with a crimson flame,
As the sun unto a rain-cloud,
So unto great Arjun came!

Indra and the gods assembled,
Blessed the man of steadfast faith;
Gave unto him arms celestial,
Showed him glory’s lofty path! (19)

“Faithful mortal! be thy wish fulfilled!”
Thus Siva spoke, and strength and faith instilled;
And Arjun came once more to Dvaita’s wood,
And reverent bowed to Yudhishthir the good. (20)

[^1]: Hindu poets are fond of conceiving that great warriors can avert the enemy’s arrow by their own in mid-air.

[^2]: The *celestial shaft* is another favourite conception of Hindu poets. Such shafts are supposed to have the power of creating darkness and light, fire and rains, snakes and eagles, &c., as described below. The idea is similar to the Greek idea of Apollo’s sending his shafts to create a plague or some other calamity.
