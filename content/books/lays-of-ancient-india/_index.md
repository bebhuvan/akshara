digitization_notes: "I'm doing this completely alone—no team, no resources, just me. I extracted the text from the source PDF using PaddleOCR, then used Google AI Studio to clean it up and add footnotes. I've done fuzzy sentence matching by scrolling through the pages, but reading every single word when you're working solo is impossible. The text is pretty clear—accuracy is well north of 95%. **Known issue:** The footnotes are right, but their placement is sometimes off. Sadly, when you're doing this alone, you don't have the time to manually edit everything. I'm relying on AI tools for cleanup and verification because I don't have any other help. Next goal is to figure out crowdsourced corrections like Project Gutenberg. For now though, if you like the book, all credit goes to me. If there are mistakes, blame the AI!"

A remarkable anthology covering five distinct periods of ancient Indian literature. From the joyous hymns of the Rig Veda (2000-1400 BC) to the sublime philosophy of the Upanishads, the noble teachings of Buddha, the righteous edicts of Emperor Asoka, and the brilliant imagery of classical Sanskrit poetry—this collection offers English readers a comprehensive view of India's rich poetic heritage.
