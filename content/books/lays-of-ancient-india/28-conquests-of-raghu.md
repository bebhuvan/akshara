## THE CONQUESTS OF RAGHU.

The piece translated below is important, as it throws light on the geography of India at the time of the poet, *i.e.*, in the sixth century after Christ.

### 1.

EASTWARD marched Ayodhyâ’s monarch,
Conquering many a sturdy foe,
Till he reached the mighty ocean,
On whose shores the palm trees grow.

### 2.

Suhma’s[^2] monarch saved his kingdom,
Bowing to the conqueror brave,—
Supple cane-twigs bend as meekly
’Neath the strong resistless wave.

### 3.

Bengal’s kings came with their war-boats,
Bravely fought, but fought in vain;
And the victor built a pillar
Where great Gangâ meets the main.

### 4.

Rice transplanted yields a harvest!
So unto the victor brave,
Conquered kings to thrones restored
Presents and rich offerings gave.

### 5.

Tuskers formed a bridge most wondrous
O’er the broad Kapisâ’s stream;[^3]
Utkal’s monarch[^4] led the victor
To Kalinga’s mighty realm.[^5]

### 6.

Fiercely fought Kalinga’s monarch
On his tusker great in height;
But in vain his arrows showered
On the victor, proud in might!

### 7.

And on beds of spreading betel
Soldiers sat and drank the wine;
And Kalinga’s fame and glory
With the wine they seemed to drain!

### 8.

But the great and noble victor
Placed the king again on throne,
Gave him back his wealth and empire,
Robbed him of his fame alone!

### 9.

Southward marched Ayodhyâ’s monarch
By the azure sparkling sea,
And through forests of the nut-palm
Marched his soldiers bold and free!

### 10.

Crossed Kâverî, mighty river,
Stopped where steep Malayas rise;
Steeds they tied in spicy forests,
Tuskers to the sandal trees.

### 11.

Mighty Pândyas,[^6] brave in combat,
Vainly with great Raghu fought;
And with pearls from Ceylon’s island
Mighty Raghu’s grace they sought.

### 12.

Across the lofty Sahya mountains[^7]
Mighty Raghu forced his way,
Far Kerala’s[^8] soft-eyed maidens
Saw his troops and fled away.

### 13.

Northwards now Ayodhyâ’s monarch
Went the Persian chiefs[^9] to quell;
Pale-faced Yavan[^10] women wept
For the chiefs who fought and fell.

### 14.

Fiercely fought each western warrior
On his fiery warlike horse;
But the victor’s swords and arrows
Swept and thinned the hostile force.

### 15.

Now the victor’s warlike soldiers
Rested in the fields of vine,[^11]
Spread the deer-skin on the heather,
Gaily quaffed the fresh grape-wine.

### 16.

Northwards then great Raghu travelled,
And his tuskers crossed the sands;
Scented pollen on them showered,
Wafted from the northern lands.

### 17.

Fiery Huns are fierce and warlike,[^12]—
Vainly fought with Kosal’s chief!
Women with their ruddy faces
Wept for warriors in their grief.

### 18.

Kamboja’s great and sturdy warriors[^13]
Quailed before Ayodhyâ’s king;
Gold and fiery steeds of battle
They unto the victor bring.

### 19.

Then the hosts of mighty Raghu
Climbed the heights of Himalay,
Beating back the stubborn hill-tribes,
Eastwards now they forced their way.

### 20.

And they crossed great Gangâ’s waters,
Crossed Lohitya’s[^14] sea-like wave;
And the lord of Prâgjyotisha[^15](Assam.) Quaked before the victor brave.

### 21.

With the tuskers of his country
Kâmrup’s lord had met his foes,—
Now those tuskers came as presents
To where Raghu’s tents arose.

### 22.

Thus great Raghu, king of monarchs,
Conquering nations far and wide,
Back returned to fair Ayodhyâ,
Ruled with glory and with pride.

*Abridged from Kâlidâsa’s Raghu-vansa, IV.*
