## A BATTLE HYMN.

“Sudâs was an Aryan king and conqueror, and we are frequently told that various Aryan tribes and kings combined against him, and he was victorious over them all. The allusions to these internecine wars among Aryan races, and to the particular tribes who fought against Sudâs, are historically among the most important passages in the Rig Veda. . . . The poet Tritsu or Vasishtha, who sang these deeds of Sudâs’s glory, was not unrewarded for his immortal verse. For in verses 22 and 23 (Hymn VII. 18) he acknowledges with gratitude that the valiant Sudâs rewarded him with two hundred cows and two chariots and four horses with gold trappings.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. p. 55.

### 1.

VARUNA glorious! Indra bright!
Our troops have eastward marched to fight.
Shining javelins in their hand,
They’ll conquer cattle, conquer land!
Quell mighty gods, the Dâsa and the foe,
And save our King Sudâs from every woe!

### 2.

When mustered nations lift on high
Their banners floating in the sky,
When warriors anxious lift their gaze
From reddened field to sky’s dark haze,
Ye mighty gods! be then our hope and stay,
And help our King Sudâs in dubious fray!

### 10.

Varuna! Indra! strong in might,
Aryaman! and Mitra bright!
Grant to us, ye sons of light,
A home and all your favours bright.
Be good to us, Aditi’s holy ray,
And we will chant Savitri’s glorious lay!

*Rig Veda*, VII. 83.
