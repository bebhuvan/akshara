## BRAHMAN,[^2] OR THE UNIVERSAL SOUL.

“The monotheism of the Upanishads, which has been the monotheism of the Hindu religion ever since, recognises God as the Universal Being; all things else have emanated from Him, are a part of Him, and will mingle with Him.”—*Civilisation in Ancient India*, vol. i. p. 191.

### 1.

THIS Universe is Brahman’s Self!
A part of Him,—these creatures all!
In Him their birth, they live in Him,
And into Him they end withal!
The mortal ever toils and works,
And as he sows upon this earth,
In virtue’s soil or ways of sin,
So reaps he in a future birth!

### 2.

He is Life,—Intelligence pure!
He is Truth and He is Light!
His soul pervades the universe,
Like ether,—escapes our mortal sight!

### 3.

Satyakâma,—truthful boy,—
To Gautama went the youth,
“I would be a student, Sir,
For I seek to know the truth.”
Gautama a welcome gave
To the boy who to him came,
“Tell me of what race thou art,
Tell me what may be thy name.”

### 4.

Satyakâma,—truthful boy,—
Spoke in grief but spoke the truth,
“Sinfully my mother wandered,
And conceived me in her youth.
And I know not who my father,
Know not of what race I am,
Jabâlâ is my poor mother,
Jabâlâ must be my name.”

### 5.

“Enough, enough, my truthful boy,”—
Spake the sage unto the youth,—
“By your worth you are a Brâhman,
For you dare to speak the truth!
Go and fetch the sacred fuel,
I will teach you, noble youth,
In the learning of our fathers,
For you have not swerved from truth!”

### 6.

Satyakâma brought the fuel,[^3]
Was a student young and brave,
And he kept his teacher’s cattle,
Served his teacher as his slave.
And unto the pathless meadows
With the cattle went the youth,
In his high and eager bosom
Nature flashed, the light of truth!

### 7.

From the strong and noble bull
Of the herd that he was tending,
From the evening’s faggot fire
Over which he pondered bending,
From the gay and bright flamingo
As it sailed across the sky,
From the diver-bird so beauteous
Which unto him was not shy,

### 8.

From the anxious contemplation
Which for ever filled his mind,
When the evening fire was lighted
And the cattle had been penned,
From each humble, lowly object,
Came its meaning to the youth,
From great Nature’s mighty wonders
Flashed on him the light of truth!

### 9.

And to Gautama he came,
And a light was on his face!
For a knowledge of the truth
Flings its glamour and its grace!
“Lo! a light is on thy face,
Dost thou know the mighty Brahman?
Only those who know the Brahman
With such light and radiance shine?”

### 10.

“Father! I have sought to know,”—
Sweetly answered thus the youth,—
“Not from men I gathered knowledge,
Nature whispered to me truth!
The earth, the quarters of the sky,
The lofty heavens, the ocean broad,
The sun and moon, the mind and soul,—
All, all is Brahman,—all is God!”

*Abridged from Chhândogya Upanishad, IV. 4.*
