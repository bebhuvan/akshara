## THE LEGEND OF UMÂ.

### 1.

GODS and men and lower beings,—
All from mighty Brahman flow!
But in vanity and blindness
Brahman great, we do not know!
Once in past and ancient ages
Vanity the gods o’ercame,—
Boastful of their power and glory,
Knew not whence that prowess came!

### 2.

Brahman to the gods appeared,
And they knew not who was He,—
Unto Agni thus they spake,—
“Know thou who this stranger be.”
Brahman placed a blade of straw,
And the mighty god of Fire
Vainly strove to burn the blade,
Went back in his shame and ire!

### 3.

Unto Vâyu, god of tempests,
Strong in might, resistless, free,
Spake the gods in secret terror,
“Know thou who this stranger be.”
Brahman placed a blade of light straw,
On it mighty Vâyu came,
Vain he strove the blade to carry,
Went back in his ire and shame!

### 4.

Unto Indra, king of bright gods,
Highest in the realms or sky,
Spake the gods with soft entreaty,
“Know thou who this stranger be.”
Indra unto Brahman came,
Knew not Brahman in his might,
Saw no stranger god before him,—
He had vanished from his sight!

### 5.

Radiant in her god-like splendour,
Umâ Haimavatî came!
Umâ of the northern mountains,—
Heavenly lore in mortal frame!
Of her Indra humbly questioned,
Who the stranger god might be,—
To him Umâ gently answered,
God of all the gods was He!

### 6.

“As the lightning’s mighty splendour
Fills the eye with dazzling light,
Knowledge of the mighty Brahman
Fills the heart with radiance bright!
From Him flows, ye gods! your prowess,
From Him worlds and oceans broad,
To Him lift your humble prayers,
He is Brahman, He is God.”

*Abridged from Kena Upanishad, III., V.*
