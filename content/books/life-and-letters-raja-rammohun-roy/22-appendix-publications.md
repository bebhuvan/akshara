*[The Editors would like to acknowledge the considerable help they have received in preparing this catalogue from the excellent bibliographies of Rammohun’s works prepared by Sj. Amal Home, Cf. Rammohun Roy, The Man and his Work Centenary Publicity Booklet-No 1, Appendix E, incorporated in The Father of Modern India, Rammohun Centenary Commemoration Volume Part II, pp. 133-47; and Brajendranath Banerji, Cf. Rammohun Roy (Sahitya Sadhak Charitmala No. 16, Fourth Edition, Calcutta 1353 B. S) pp. 80-105. Regarding Rammohun’s publications in England, the list in Mary Carpenter’s Last Days in England of Raja Rammohun Roy Appendix A, (Calcutta Edition, 1915) pp. 219-21, has also been found useful. The present list excludes Rammohun’s personal letters.]*

**A. Works in Arabic-Persian.**

1. *Tuhafat-ul-Muwahhiddin*. 1803-04. (The text is in Persian with an Arabic introduction.)

2. *Manazarat-ul-Adyan*. No copy of the book has as yet been found. Some modern writers doubt whether it was at all published, though Rammohun makes a reference to it in the pages of the *Tuhfat*. Kazi Abdul Odood however thinks that it must have been circulated either in printed or in manuscript form. For the controversy, Cf. above, pp. 35-36.

3. *Javav-i-Tuhfat-ul-Muwahhiddin*. 1820 (?). An anonymous Persian booklet written in defence of Rammohun’s *Tuhfat* against the attacks of the Zoroastrians, now in the British Museum Library, London. Possibly written by Rammohun Roy (Cf. above, p. 36).

Rammohun’s *Tuhfat-ul Muwahhidin* has been translated into English by Maulavi Obaidullah El Obaide and published by the Adi Brahmo Samaj, Calcutta in 1884 (Cf. above, p. 18n).

A Bengali translation from the orginal Arabic-Persian text was published by the late Girish Chandra Sen the famous missionary of the Bharatvarshiya Brahmo Samaj and an erudite scholar in Islamic theology, serially in the fortnightly journal *Dharmatattva* 1821 Śaka, Vaiśākha 1, p. 78; Vaiśākha 16, pp. 88-89; Jyaistha 1, pp. 98-100; Jyaistha 16, p. 113; Ashādha 16, pp. 137-38; Śravaṇa 1, pp. 148-49; Śravaṇa 16, pp. 161-62; Bhādra 16, pp. 183-84 (Vol. 34, Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 16 respectively). The available Bengali translation in the form of a booklet by Sj. Jyotirindranath Das, published by the Sādhāran Brahmo Samaj, Calcutta, 1949, is from Obaidullah’s English version.

**B. Works in Bengali and Sanskrit.**

1. *Vedānta-Grantha*. 1815. (It is a commentary on the *Brahma-sūtras* in Bengali.)

2. *Vedāntasāra*. 1815. (A short summary of the *Vedānta-Grantha* in Bengali).

3. *Talabakāropanishat* or *Kenopanishat*. (Bengali translation according to the gloss of Śankarāchārya). 1816.

4. *Isopanishat*. (Bengali translation according to the gloss of Śankarāchārya). 1816.

5. *Utsabānanda Vidyavāgiser Sahit Vichar*. (Śāstric disputes with Utsabānanda Vidyāvāgis). 1816-17. Under this head Rammohun composed three pamphlets in Sanskrit. In the end he succeeded in converting his orthodox adversary to his views and Utsabānanda is known to have joined the Brahmo Samaj when that organisation was started in 1828, as reader and expounder of the Upanishads.

The texts were discovered by Dr. V. Ray of Giridih in the Serampore College Library. The second of Rammohun’s pamphlets in this series was translated into Bengali by Sj Nalin Chandra Ganguli in the *Pravāsī* Kārtik, 1335 B. S. pp. 104-10. The translation has been reprinted in the *Vańgiya Sāhitya Parishad* Edition of Rammohun’s Bengali and Sanskrit Works-2, pp. 26-34.

6. *Bhattacharyer Sahit Vichār* (Śāstric disputes with Bhattacharya). 1817. It is a reply in Bengali to the criticisms of Rammohun’s *Vedānta-Grantha*, contained in Mrityunjaya Vidyalaṁkāra’s *Vedānta-Chandrikā* which was also published in 1817.

7. *Kathopanishat*. (Bengali translation according to the gloss of Śankarāchārya). 1817.

8. *Māṇḍukyopanishat*. (Bengali translation according to the gloss of Śankarāchārya). 1817.

9. *Gosvīmir Sahit Vichār* (Śāstric disputes with Gosvīmi). 1818. It is a reply in Bengali to the criticisims of a Vaishnavite opponent.

10. *Sahamaran Vishaye Pravartak O Nibartaker Sam̄bād* (A Conference between an Advocate and an Opponent of the Custom of Burning Widows Alive). 1818. Rammohun’s first Bengali tract on Suttee.

11. *Gāyatrī Artha*. An exposition in Bengali of the famous *Gāyatrī* mantra of the Rig Veda (III. 62.10). 1818.

12. *Muṇḍakopanishat*. (Bengali translation according to the gloss of Śankarāchārya). 1819.

13. *Ātmānātmaviveka* of Śankarāchārya with Bengali translation. 1819 (?). There is some doubt regarding the exact year of publication (Cf. *Rammohana-Granthāvalī* published by the Vańgiya Sāhitya Parishad—4, p. 76; Brajendranath Banerji Rammohun Roy 4th Edition p. 89).

14. *Sahamaraṇ Vishaye Pravartak Nivartaker Dvitīya Sam̄vād* (A Second Conference between an Advocate and an Opponent of the Practice of Burning Widows Alive). 1819. Rammohun’s second Bengali tract on Suttee. It is a reply to the criticisms of Rammohun’s first Bengali tract against Suttee, contained in Pandit Kashinath Tarkavagis’ Bengali pamphlet *Vidhāyak Nishedhaker Sambād* which had been published with an English translation from Calcutta earlier in 1819.

15. *Kavitākārer Sahit Vichār* (Śāstric Disputes with the Composer of Verses). 1820. A work in Bengali in reply to an anonymous apponent who has been mentioned as *Kavitākāra* or the “composer of verses.” The identity of the adversary has not been discovered.

16. *Subrahmaṇya Śāstrīr Sahit Vichār* (Śāstric Disputes with Subrahmaṇya Śāstrī). 1820. This was published simultaneously in four languages, Sanskrit, Bengali, Hindi and English. The third annual report of the School Book Society mentions a tract by Rammohun Roy under the title “Reply to the Observations of Sobha Sastree.” No separate work of that name however has come to light as yet. The editors of the Vaṅgiya Sāhitya Parishad Collection of Rammohun’s Bengali and Sanskrit works are probably right in their supposition that “Sobha Sastree” in the above context, is only an abbreviation of the name Subrahmaṇya Śāstrī and the reference in the School Book Society’s report is to the extant work *Subrahmaṇya Śāstrīr Sahit Vichār* (*Rammohana-Granthavali*, Sahitya Parishad Ed.-2, p. 103.).

17. *Brāhmaṇa Sevadhi: Brāhmaṇa O Misinari Sam̄vād* (Numbers 1, 2 and 3). 1821. A general defence of Brahmanical Hindism against the attacks of the Christian Missionaries (Cf. above, pp. 160-61). The first three numbers of the *Brāhmaṇa Sevadhi* were published together with their English translations entitled *The Brahmunical Magazine: The Missionary and the Brahmun*.

18. *Chāri Praśner Uttar* (Reply to the Four Questions ). 1822. The tract contains Rammohun’s reply to four questions asked by an orthodox opponent in the columns of the *Samāchār Darpan* April 6, 1822, under the signature, *Dharmasam̄sthāpanākāṅkshī* (one desiring to establish religion).

19. *Prārthanāpatra*. 1823. This is a tract on the nature of universal monotheistic worship. It was published together with an English version entitled *Humble Suggestions to his Countrymen who believe in the One True God*.

20. *Pādri O Śishya Sam̄vād*. 1823 (?). It contains a trenchant criticism of the principles of Trinitarian Christianity in the shape of an imaginary dialogue between a Trinitarian missionary and three Chinese converts to Trinitarian Christianity. Its English version entitled *Dialogue between a Trinitarian Missionary and three Chinese Converts* was published in 1823. The date of the publication of the Bengali tract may be tentatively inferred from this.

21. *Gurupādukā*. 1823. The book which has not been found, is mentioned in Rev. Long’s Descriptive Catalogue of Bengali Books (Calcutta, 1855) p.103. It appears to have been a small tract circulated in reply to an earlier anonymous attack (entitled *Jñānāñjanaśalākā*) on Rammohun. (It’s preface has been printed in the Bengali magazine *Chhota Galpa* Paush 1, 1340. B. S., Vol. II No. 24, p. 1179; Cf. *Rammohana Granthāvalī* Vańgiya Sāhitya Parishad Ed., Bibliography at the end, p. 73.)

22. *Pathyapradān* or Medicine for the Sick. 1823. An elaborate reply to Pandit Kashinath Tarkapañchānan’s *Pāshaṇḍa Pīḍana* also published in 1823 (Cf. above, p 148).

23. *Brahmaniṣhṭha Grihasther Lakshman*. 1826. It discusses the signs of a householder who is truly devoted to Brahman.

24. *Kāyasther Sahit Madyapān Vishayak Vichār* (A Śāstric dispute with a gentleman of the Kāyastha caste, over the question of the drinking of wine). 1826. The tract was published under the signature “Ramchandra Das.”

25. *Vajrasūchī* (Sanskrit text and Bengali translation of the *Vajrasūchi Upanishad*, a Mahāyāna Buddhist text which criticises the Brahmanical caste system). 1827. (Cf. above, pp. 238-39).

26. *Gāyatryā Paramopāsanāvidhānam*. 1827. A Sanskrit-Bengali tract on the means of worshipping the Absolute through the *Gāyatrī Mantra*. Its English translation was also published the same year.

27. *Brahmopāsanā*. 1828. A tract on Divine Worship.

28. *Brahmasaṅgīt*. 1828. A Book of Bengali devotional hymns containing compositions of Rammohun Roy and his intimate associates. (Cf. above, p. 235n.)

29. *Anuṣhṭhān*. 1829. A Bengali tract which under the from of a dialogue between a master (*āchārya*) and his disciple (*śiṣya*), discusses Rammohun’s concept of *Upāsanā* (divine worship) and its ideal method. The tract though small, is one of Rammohun’s most important theological publications. In this connection mention may be made of a work by Rammohun, entitled *Abataraṇikā* said to have been published in 1829, and mentioned by Rev. J. Long in his Descriptive Catalogue of Bengali Books (Calcutta 1855) p. 103. Possibly this is the same tract as *Anuṣhṭhān*, as the short introduction of the last-named tract also calls itself *Abataraṇikā*. Further, Rev. Long describes *Abataraṇikā* as a Sanskrit-Bengali work “on 12 questions with their answers and proofs, from the Bhagavat Gita on worship.” Rammohun’s *Anuṣhṭhān* also contains twelve questions and answers. The only point of discrepancy is that Rammohun in *Anuṣhṭhān* does not quote scriptural proof only from the *Gītā* but from other texts like the *Brihadāraṇyaka Upanishad*, *Taittirīya Upanishad*, *Muṇḍaka Upanishad*, *Kena Upanishad*, *Chhāndogya Upanishad*, *Kaṭha Upanishad*, *Brahma-Sūtras*, *Gauḍapādā’s Kārikā*, *Vishṇu-Purāṇa*, *Manu-sam̄hitā*, and *Mahānirvāṇa-Tantra*, as well.

30. *Sahamaraṇ Vishaya*. 1829. This is Rammohun’s last Bengali tract on Suttee published as reply to the attacks of two orthodox opponents who wrote under the pen-names of “Vipra” and “Mughabodha-chhātra”.

31. *Kshudra Patrī*. (Exact time of the pubilication of this leaflet, containing two Upanishadic verses and two elegant Sanskrit hymns composed by Rammohun, is unknown. It was published apparently before Rammohun had sailed for England and was meant as the sub-title states, for free distribution.)

32. *Gauḍīya Vyākaraṇ*. 1833. It is a grammar of the Bengali language written on the model of Rammohun’s earlier work in English on the same subject printed in 1826. The text was published by the Calcutta School Book Society in April 1833, when Rammohun was in England (Cf. above, pp. 192-93, 295-96).

Apart from the above works, Rammohun had published a Bengali verse-translation of the entire *Bhāgavat Gītā* but unfortunately the book has not been traced. It must have come out sometime before 1829, because Rammohun has made a reference to it in his *Sahamaraṇ Vishaya* published in that year (Cf. *Rammohana-Granthāvalī* Vaṅgīya Sāhitya Parishad Edition-3, p. 56). Besides Rammohun had published his own editions of a number of Upanishads as well as of Śaṅkara’s entire commentary on the *Brahma-Sūtras* (Cf. above, pp. 98-100). These however cannot be included in a list of his original writings. The third annual report of the School Book Society (1819-20) mentions a Bengali work of Rammohun entitled “Reply to a MS of Ram-gopala Sormono”. No book of this name has however come to light as yet. The editors of the Vaṅgiya Sāhitya Parishad collection of Rammohun’s Sanskrit and Bengali works think that the work may be identical with *Gosvāmir Sahit Vichār* (Cf. above, no. 9 in the present list). This appears to be an unwarranted assumption in the present state of our knowledge.

A word must also be said here about a Bengali tract called *Brāhma-Pauttalika Sam̄vād* mentioned by Rev. Long (*Catalogue* p. 103) to have been a work of Rammohun Roy published in 1820. In an earlier notice in the Third Annual Report of the Calcutta School Book Society (1819-20) however the authorship of the book has been attributed to Brajamohun Majumdar one of the intimate associates of Rammohun. The work had also been translated into English in 1821 under the title “A Tract against the prevailing system of Hindoo Idolatry”. In the preface to the English translation too the European translator mentions Brajamohun Majumdar as the author of the original Bengali text (Cf. *The Father Of Modern India: Rammohun Centenary Commemoration Volume* Part II p. 126). A possible explanation of this anomaly may be that Rammohun actually wrote and published the book under the signature of his friend Brajamohun Majumdar. The persistent assumption of pen-names and, the names of his friends and followers in publishing his own writings was one of Rammohun’s well-known habits (Cf. above, p. 217). Until however the question of authorship is finally settled, it would be unsafe to include *Brāhma-Pauttalika Sam̄vād* in a list of Rammohun’s works. A critical edition of this Bengali tract together with its English translation is at present being prepared by Dr. Stephen N. Hay of the University of Chicago., U. S. A.

The first collected edition of Rammohun Roy’s Bengali works was published in 1839 by Sj Annada Prasad Banerji, zamindar of Telinipara, (Hooghly Dt., West Bengal), who belonged to the circle of Rammohun’s distinguished friends and followers. Subsequently the following collections of his Bengali and Sanskrit works have been published: (1) *Raja Rammohan Raya Pranita Granthavali*, edited by Rajnarayan Basu and Ananda Chandra Vedāntavāgiś, Adi Brahmo Samaj Press, Calcutta, 1880; (2) *Rājā Rammohana Rāyer Sanskrita O Vāṅgāla Granthāvalī*, printed at the Kuntalin Press, Calcutta and published by the Panini Office, Allahabad, 1905; (3) *Rammohana-Granthāvalī* edited by Brajendranath Banerji and Sajani Kanta Das, published by the Vaṅgīya Sāhitya Parishad (Calcutta, 1359 B.S.)

**C. Works in Hindi.**

1. *Vedānta-Grantha* (Hindi translation from the Bengali original). 1815 (?)

2. *Vedāntasāra* (Hindi translation from the Bengali original). 1815 (?)

The two above works have unfortunately not yet been traced. Rammohun refers to these Hindi publications of his in the preface to *An Abridgment of the Vedant* (Calcutta, 1816) (Cf. *The English Works of Raja Rammohun Roy* ed. Nag and Burman, Part II pp 59-60). Pandit Kshitīmohana Sen Śāstrī mentions having seen a copy of the Hindi translation apparently of the *Vedānta-Grantha* in his boyhood at the house of Sj Abhayacharn Bhattacharya of Mirzapur (U. P.) (Cf. his *Yugaguru Rammohana*, Calcutta, 1952, p. 8)

3. *Subhrmaṇya Śāstrīr Sahit Vichār* (Hindi version). 1820.

Rammohun’s Hindi prose style has been discussed by Pandit Hazari Prasad Dvivedi in a Bengali article entitled “Hindi Bhashaya Rammohana” (Cf. *The Father of Modern India: Rammohun Centenary Commemoration Volume*, Part II pp. 465-68).

**D. Works in English.** (Published from Calcutta):

1. *Translation of an Abridgment of the Vedant or Resolution of all the Veds; the most celebrated and revered work of Brahminical Theology; establishing the Unity of the Supreme Being; and that He Alone is the object of Propitiation and Worship*. 1816.

2. *Translation of the Cena [Kena] Upanishad, one of the chapters of the Sāma Veda; according to the gloss of the celebrated Shancaracharya: establishing the Unity and the Sole Omnipotence of the Supreme Being; and that He Alone is the Object of Worship*. 1816.

3. *Translation of the Ishopanishad, one of the chapters of the Yajur Ved: according to the commentary of the celebrated Shankaracharya: establishing the Unity and Incomprehensibility of the Supreme Being; and that His Worship alone can lead to Eternal Beatitude*. 1816.

4. *A Defence of Hindoo Theism in reply to the Attack of an Advocate for Idolatry at Madras*. 1817.

5. *A Second Defence of the Monotheistical System of the Vedas in reply to an apology for the present state of Hindoo Worship*. 1817. This is a reply to Mrityunjaya Vidyālaṁkāra’s *An Apology for the present system of Hindoo Worship* published in 1817.

6. *Counter-Petition of the Hindu Inhabitants of Calcutta against Suttee*. 1818.

7. *Translation of a conference between an Advocate for, and an Opponent of, the Practice of Burning Widows Alive, from the original Bungla*. 1818.

10. *An Apology for the Pursuit of Final Beatitude, independently of Brahmunical Observances*. 1820. It is the English version of Rammohun’s scriptural dispute with Pandit Subrahmanya Śāstrī

12. *The Precepts of Jesus, the Guide to Peace and Happiness; extracted from the Books of the New Testament ascribed to the four Evangelists. With translations into Sungscrit and Bengalee*. 1820.

The promised Sanskrit and Bengali translations were never published by Rammohun. A Bengali translation of the book was however published by Sj Rakhaldas Haldar under the title *Sukhaśāntir Upāyasvarūp Yīsu-praṇīta Hitopadeś* (Calcutta 1859). It may be noted here that Rammohun’s *Precepts of Jesus* created a tradition of liberal intrepretion of Christ’s teachings in Christian circles and inspired the Earl of Northbrook to publish his *The Teachings of Jesus Christ in His Own Words* (London, Sampson Low, Morston & Co. 1900). In his preface (p.v) Northbrook writes: “My purpose has been to put before them [the People of India] the Teaching of Christ in His own words, as recorded in the four Gospels.......The learned and distinguished Hindu, Raja Rammohun Roy, published eighty years ago a compilation called ‘The Precepts of Jesus, the guide to peace and happiness’, with the same object in view, but in a different shape.”

11. *Appeal to the British Nation against a violation of common justice and a breach of public faith by the Supreme Government of India with the Native Inhabitants*. London, 1832(?) The library of the Foreman Christian College, Lahore, possesses a copy of the tract. On September 29, 1829, the Government of India rejected the appeal which Rammohun had submitted on behalf of the land-holders of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa against Regulation III of 1828 for the resumption of Lakheraj Lands. While in England, Rammohun preferred a further appeal on the matter to the Court of Directors in the name of his companion Ramratna Mukherjee. Even this failing to produce any result, he published the above booklet in the name of the same Ramratna Mukherjee. The *Times* of London came out in its issues of April 6 and 13, 1833, with some adverse remarks on the action of the Government regarding this particular problem. The criticisms were sought to be met by an anonymous supporter of the India Government in the *Asiatic Journal* (May to August, 1833, pp. 109-11), under the signature A. B. In the same volume of the Journal (pp. 214-18) a detailed reply was given to A. B. by a correspondent who signed C. D. Possibly the latter was no other than Rammohun. The booklet together with the criticisms and discussions it generated in the pages of the *Times*, the *Asiatic Journal* etc., has been printed in J. K. Majumdar’s *Raja Rammohun Roy and Progressive Movements in India* Appendix III, pp. 512-35.

3. *Appeal to the Christian Public in Defence of the Precepts of Jesus*. Boston (?), Christian Register Office (?), about April, 1826. Miss. Adrienne Moore is not certain whether it was really an American edition of any of the Appeals or merely an advertisement by the Christian Register Office, of the 1823 London (Hunter) edition of the Final Appeal. No 1826 copy of any American edition of any of the Appeals, has so far been found.

6. *Brief Extracts from Rammohun Roy’s Appeals*. Philadelphia Unitarian Association Publication 183—? Miss Moore adds the following comment: “This is possibly an excerpt torn from some publication”.

Miss Moore mentions as appendix to her list, a publication entitled *Address to the Members of Congress on the Abolition of Slavery* Washington, D. C. (?), 1830-1833 (?), and adds: “This document on slavery is signed ‘Rammohun Roy’, but the name is merely a pseudonym, as seen from the lines: ‘In closing this address allow me to assume the name of one of the most enlightened and benevolent of the human race now living, though not a white man, Rammohun Roy’.” (*Rammohun Roy and America* p. 52).

**G. German edition**

**H. Dutch Edition**

1 *Vertaling Van Verscheidene voername Boeken. Platsen en Teksten van de Veddas. Naar het Engelsch door P. P. Rooda Van Eysinga*. Kampen, 1840.
