## RAMMOHUN ROY’S LETTER TO ROBERT DALE OWEN.

**48 Bedford Square**
**April 19th 1833**

**Dear Sir,**

Not having been sufficiently fortunate yesterday to find you, or any of your friends at home I feel induced to make one or two remarks in writing to which, from what I have heard from you on Tuesday night, I think you will agree. They are as follows:—It is not necessary either in England or in America, to oppose Religion in promoting the Social domestic and political welfare of their Inhabitants particularly a system of Religion which inculcates the doctrine of Universal love and charity. Did such philanthropists as Locke or Newton oppose Religion? No! They rather tried to remove the perversions gradually introduced in Religions. Admitting for a moment that the Truth of the Divinity of Religion cannot be established to the satisfaction of a freethinker, but from an impartial enquiry, I presume we may feel persuaded to believe that a system of Religion (Christianity) which consists in love and charity is capable of furthering our happiness, facilitating our reciprocal transactions and curbing our obnoxious suspicions and feelings. I grieve to observe that by opposing Religion your most benevolent father has hitherto impeded his success. He, I seriously believe, is a follower of Christianity in the above sense though he is not aware of being so. Allow me to send Hamiltons (Hamilton’s) East Indies (1st vol.) in which you will find page 35 line 36, that more than two thousand years ago wise and pious Brahmans of India entertained almost the same opinions which your father offers though they by no means were destitute of religion.

My desire to see you and your father crowned with success in your benevolent undertakings, has emboldened me to make these observations, a freedom which I hope, you will, in consideration of my motives, excuse. With my best compliments to your father and kind regards to Mrs. Owen and Miss Owen. I remain with my best wishes for your success

**Dear Sir**
**Yours very faithfully,**
**Rammohun Roy**

P.S. I am now troubled with a strong attack of Influenza, which prevents me from sitting for a few minutes or writing a few lines. R. R.[^1]
