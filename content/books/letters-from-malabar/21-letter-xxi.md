**Account of the Chegos, and other low castes of Malabar.**

The lower orders of Malabar are divided into several castes, differing considerably in rank and dignity. We will first notice the Chegos, who came in very ancient times to this country, of which they may be reckoned, on account of their long habitation and similarity of religion, as natives. The tradition is that they came originally from Ceylon, where they belonged to the military caste, in consequence of the following circumstance. In the time of Cheramperoumal, a woman belonging to the caste of the washermen, whose house adjoined that of an Ajari (the carpenter caste), being occupied as usual in washing a cloth in water mixed with ashes (which is here used for soap), and having no one at hand to hold the other end of it, called to a young daughter of the Ajari, who was alone in the house, to assist her. The child, not knowing that this was an infringement of the laws of her caste, did as she was requested, and then went home. The washerwoman was emboldened by this affair to enter the Ajari's house a few days afterwards; and upon the latter demanding angrily how she dared to cross his threshhold, the woman answered scornfully that he belonged now to the same caste as she did, since his daughter had helped to hold her cloth. The Ajari, learning the disgrace that had befallen him, killed the washerwoman. Upon this, her friends complained to Cheramperoumal, who espoused their cause and threatened the carpenters; whereupon the latter combined together to take refuge in Ceylon, where they were favourably received by the king of Candy, for whom the Malabars have great veneration. Cheramperoumal was placed in great embarrassment by their departure, having no one in his dominions who could build a house or make a spoon, and begged the king of Candy to send them back, promising to do them no injury. The Ajaris would not place entire confidence in these promises, but asked the king to send with them two Chegos and their wives, to witness Cheramperoumal's conduct towards them, and to protect them. The king granted their request, with the stipulation that on all high occasions, such as weddings and deaths and other ceremonies, the Ajaris should bestow three measures of rice on each of these Chegos and their descendants, as a tribute for this protection; a custom which still exists. If the Ajari is too poor to afford the outlay, he is still obliged to present the requisite quantity of rice, which is then given back to him again; the privilege of the Chegos being thus maintained. From these two couples all the Chegos of Malabar are said to be descended.

This caste comes next below that of the Sudras, but is considered much less honourable. In times of civil war or rebellion, the Chegos are bound to take up arms for the lawful sovereign; and some princes employ them as soldiers on other occasions, if they have not a sufficient force of Nairs. Their principal occupation is that of drawing *toddy*, which is compulsory on their caste; this operation, as you know, is performed by cutting off the top of the cocoa-palm, and collecting in vessels the juice which exudes from it. The Chegos are sub-divided into two castes: the Chegos and the Twen Chegos.

Next to the Chegos are the *Coelugoeryp*, who make bows, arrows, shields and other weapons of war, and the *Canniar-goeryp*, whose vocation is to teach the art of fencing and the use of weapons; with these we must reckon the *Coetady* or trumpeters.

After these castes follow others still lower in rank, consisting of: 1st, the *Cannianol*, who are astrologers; 2nd, the *Corwaas*, or exorcisers of evil spirit; 3rd, the *Cuca Corwaas*, snake charmers and diviners; and 4th, the *Poenen Poeloon*, who accompany them with tambourines or small drums. These four castes are in some measure distinct, but resemble each other in their strict separation from other castes in their unsettled mode of life, wandering from place to abode and earning their livelihood by exorcisms, jugglery, snake-charming, &c., like the heathens in Europe: and in their independence, for they manage their own law suits, punish their own criminals, and are subject to no Prince or Rajah.

Another caste are the *Mocquaas*, who inhabit the seashores and subsist by fishing. We cannot wonder that many of them have become Romish Christians, as the Europeans have so much influence in those parts of the country.

The slave castes, the members of which belong to individual masters, are : 1st, the *Cannekaas*, who gather the cocoanuts ; and 2nd, the *Bettoas*, who make saltpans and collect the salt : these two are the most honourable of the slave castes.

Then follow the Pulleahs, who are again subdivided into several classes : the *Collamary* or smiths ; the *Weltoe Carens*, the *Beltoe Pulleahs*, and the *Canna Pulleahs*, whose occupation is agriculture, sowing, planting and cutting the Nely, for which they receive, both from their proprietors and from strangers, one sheaf out of every ten they cut. There is a dispute between the Cannekaas and the Pulleahs as to which is the higher caste, for there is room even among these miserable creatures for pride ; the first maintaining that their caste ranks first, whilst the Pulleahs aver that they enjoy more privileges, as for instance that they may employ barbers, and may wear a fillet on their heads and a long garment reaching to the knees, which the Cannekaas may not do.

The Pariahs are divided into two castes ; the *Canni Pariahs* and the *Asse Pariahs*. They are regarded as outcasts ; their usual occupation is making rice winnows and baskets, and they are also cow-doctors, and have a right to flay the carcases of cows and to keep the hides for themselves. They are permitted to eat the flesh of cows that have died, and often devour it raw.

Besides these there are three jungle castes : 1st, the *Ollares*, who collect honey and wax in the jungles, where these articles are found in great abundance, and are brought down to the coast by merchants and thence exported to other countries. The Ollares wear no clothing, and regard the tiger as their uncle. When one of these animals dies, either naturally or by violence, they shave their heads in token of mourning, and eat no cooked food for three days ; they may eat no flesh but that of animals which have been killed by tigers, so that the existence of these wild beasts is of great consequence to them.

The *Wedden* and the *Naiaddy* are also bushmen who hunt wild beasts and subsist upon their flesh, as well as upon herbs and roots ; so that there are many among these three castes who have never tasted rice.

I have thus given you a brief account of the low castes, who come little if at all under the notice of us Europeans, and are therefore little thought of.
