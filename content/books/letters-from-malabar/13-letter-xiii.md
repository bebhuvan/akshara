**Ecclesiastical and temporal grandees in Malabar—Customary salutations between the higher and lower orders in their daily intercourse; and their modes of shewing respect.**

I hope you will not object to my writing you a letter on "miscellaneous topics," tending to a more full acquaintance with the affairs of Malabar. First, I will mention the magnates of this country, who may be distinguished as the Spiritual and the Temporal grandees.

The Malabar Brahmans, or *Namboories* as they are called, in some cases exert secular authority, being the possessors of certain domains, with Nairs or soldiers in their service, and the power of capital punishment over their subjects; being amenable to no superior sovereign or rajah. They have also the patronage of all offices and dignities within their territories, so that in this respect, also, they are independent in the same manner as some of the German bishops, only that their dignity is hereditary, whereas that of the German bishop is electoral.

The *Namboories* are also sometimes lords over certain territories, exercising the right of making war. The four principal Namboories are those of Eincour, Manacaloa, Poenetoer, and Ella Enganare, who are very powerful. The Namboories are neither spiritual nor temporal sovereigns, but may be called half spiritual, half temporal. In order to understand this we must remark that in the old times of Cheramperoumal, when that monarch had reigned twelve years, many people wished to summon a new emperor from Hindostan to fill his place, whilst others were desirous to keep him in power, on account of his sage government. Now, the first party, having introduced their new emperor into the country, some Brahmans of the other side went to meet him, cut off his head, and brought it to Cheramperoumal, who was then at Telepale near Amkoer. In consequence of this deed they lost caste, indeed, but Cheramperoumal to shew his gratitude made them *Namboories* and gave them the lands of Tellepale for a perpetual possession.

The Caimals are temporal potentates, also, possessing the right of making war. Some of them are subject to the princes in whose territories they are situated ; but others are independant : the difference depends on the privileges they received in ancient times. The Malabars say that there are fifty Caimals in the Kingdom of Cochin.

The Rasidoors are lords who have been raised by the Rajahs to certain commands over the army or country. In many places they are appointed to govern a district or town in the name of the prince. Besides these, there is another class, namely, the *Menons*, that is to say scribes, whose office it is to write the letters of their Rajahs and great people with an iron style on the *olas* or leaves of cocoanut trees, to record public affairs, to make out business letters, and also to tie up and seal the Prince's letters, which may not be done by common persons. These Menons rise indeed to higher dignities, sometimes even becoming captains and chiefs of the army, when they acquire the title of *Menon Mare*. The Goeryps (who are the fencing masters) are likewise held in great esteem, some Princes and Rajahs bear this title, as for instance, the Goeryp of Travancore.

And now to another subject. I will here describe the manner in which the lower classes shew respect to the higher, and some other of their customary gestures, in which their manners bear a marked difference from those of the Europeans. While with us a shake of the head is a sign of refusal or denial, with the Malabars on the contrary to incline the head from side to side signifies affirmation and satisfaction. A negative they express by opening and closing the thumb and first two fingers.

No greater affront can be shown to a Malabar than by striking him with the stalk on which a cocoanut grows. A remarkable instance of this occurred not long ago. A Quilon-kara (as the black Christians of Quilon are called), going to the house of a Chego to tap toddy, hard words happened to pass between him and the Chego's mother, and the Quilon-kara, waxing impatient, struck the woman with one of the aforesaid stalks. She related the affront to her son who was not present on the occasion; and he immediately threatened to take the life of the Quilon-kara. The latter perceiving the imminent danger he was in, fled to Quilon, thinking that the affair would be forgotten in time; but on his return, after seven months, the Chego discovered and murdered him, and then took flight and escaped punishment.

The modes of salutation differ according to the quality of the parties. When a subject meets a Caimal Ragiadoor or any other grandee belonging to the Court, he lowers his sword placing it with its point to the ground; or if he has no sword takes off his head dress. Before Rajahs or Princes they must perform a peculiar mode of salutation. They re-cover their heads and joining the palms of their hands raise them to the forehead, then separate them and then open and close their fists thrice before their heads. The Princes must make the same obeisance to the Rajah as first Prince, but they are not obliged to uncover their heads. The petty Rajahs, subordinate to the Rajah of Cochin (those of Mangatti, Porcād, &c.), must thus show their respect to him, and they must remove their upper garment in his presence and remain bare shouldered till he gives them permission to resume it. The Princes of Porcād and Paroer being Brahmans, have alone the privilege of being seated in the presence of the Rajah of Cochin. The former of these, who is superior both in sanctity and rank, may sit on the same couch with the Rajah who takes his hand and places it in his bosom. There is also a high seat prepared for him by the side of the Rajah when he visits him. These visitations are very expensive to the Rajah, who has to provide food for the princes and their retinues, amounting to more than 100 individuals, the whole time they last or to give money in place of food.

The women make the same obeisances as the men, letting fall their veils or coverings, and folding their arms in front. If the Queen mother is older than the Rajah, on his first visit to her after his accession, he must bend his head down to the ground, and lay both his hands joined together on his head, which is the highest mark of respect. If the Queen mother or the eldest Princess of the Royal family is younger than the Rajah, she must perform the same reverence to him.

The ordinary grandees and others salute each other by an inclination of the head on one side : sometimes the common people fall on one knee before the Rajah, and join their hands over their heads. Others embrace each other with one or both arms. Subjects on their first introduction to the Rajah lay presents at his feet, as a token of respect. The Rajah rewards a grandee or general who has done any special service by the gift of a *somereel*, palanquin [a *somereel* in the Portuguese language means a sun screen made of the leaves of the cocoa tree or palmyra fastened in a slight wooden frame], or, a gold bracelet or earrings. These gifts, though themselves of little value, are regarded as marks of great honour.

The Rajah of Cochin in some respects ranks higher, and possesses more privileges than the Rajahs of Travancore, Colastri, and the Zamorin. Thus, if these four Princes travelling together, were to approach the house of a Pulleah, the Rajah of Cochin must be the first to enter; and so if they were to bathe together no one must enter the water until he has first set foot in it, after which they must all imitate his proceedings. If a Nair lose caste in any kingdom, no one has power to restore him, except the Rajah of Cochin, who presents him with a *guide* or vessel of water to drink. It is not every one who is privileged to approach equally near to the Rajah. A Chego must keep a distance of 30 paces, a Nair may come nearer but may not touch him; but a Pulleah may never be seen in the place, where he is, while the Brahmans have free access and have the privilege of preparing every thing, even to his food, for him.

When the Zamorin writes to the Rajah of Cochin, or any of the superior Princes to each other, the letter must be addressed not to the Prince, but to the chief Rasidoor, who in Cochin is called the Naicoviti, and the chief Rasidoor of the Zamorin is called the Mangatatja. If a Nair brings a letter from his Rajah to another, or to the Commandant, he must prostrate himself thrice in token of reverence; a Brahman or Pattari is exempt from this ceremony. When the Rajah is employed in religious offices no one may speak to him, not even a Brahman; but if any very important circumstance occurs which demands his attention, he must be informed of it by certain signs on the fingers.

And now having told you so much of manners of the Malabars in their intercourse together, perhaps you will like to hear how they conduct themselves in their dealings with the Europeans. In the time of the Portuguese, there was a quarrel between their soldiers and the Nairs about the right of way in their casual meetings. The dispute ran so high (according to the Portuguese) that at last it was agreed between the Rajah and the Portuguese General in Chief that it should be settled by a duel between a member of each party, and that the conqueror should win the right for his associates. For this purpose the Rajah selected his most able fencing master, who was well versed in the use of sword and shield. The Portuguese also made choice of the bravest of his army for his champion, but dressed him in common sailor's clothes, so that if he were to lose, the disgrace might not fall on the army: however he prostrated his adversary three times, and the Rajah, unconscious of the deception, was very much surprised that a common sailor should display such dexterity. Since this time, the Nairs have always conceded the right of way to the Europeans, except in one or two instances in my time, when they have disputed that right with our soldiers, who resisted their incivility so valiantly that they have not had courage to repeat it.

When a Rajah visits the town the Commandant receives him at his residence at the foot of the stairs, and leads him up by the right hand. If a Prince come to visit him, he is received on the steps ; a caimal or other grandee, the Commandant receives in the hall, where he makes him take a seat. At their first entrance into the town, the Rajahs are conducted from the gate by two members of the political council, with the attendance of armed troops. One member of the council and the chief interpreter perform this office for an inferior prince. They are conducted out of the town in the same manner, the prince walks in the middle, or on the right hand of his conductor. They are also saluted with artillery, the number of discharges being proportioned to their rank. For the Rajah of Cochin, eleven salutes are fired, for the other Rajahs of the kingdom nine, for the petty Rajahs seven, and for other members of the Royal families, five or three.

When the Commandant goes to Court, he is received by the Rajah at the foot of the stairs, unless that Prince is in mourning, in which case the office is performed by the second Prince, or any other who may happen to be at Court. When deputies from the political council go to court, they are accompanied by two servants, and may sit down with their heads covered ; but the chief interpreter must stand uncovered.

When a new Commandant and Rajah meet for the first time, presents are exchanged between them; the Commandant presenting gifts prepared by the Company for the purpose, while the Rajah loads him with gold chains and bracelets, and presents are distributed among his suite in proportion to their rank. The Rajahs fasten these bracelets with their own hands on the arms of those to whom they present them, which, as they are rather small, often occasions pain, as I know by experience. Some of the bracelets are plain, others chased. The Company's gifts consist of stuffs, sugar, rosewater, spices, &c. But as the Rajahs generally sell them under their real value, they would be better pleased if money was given them instead, as they deem it no disgrace to receive pecuniary gifts.
