# AN ACCOUNT OF TRAVANCORE, AND FRA BARTOLOMEO'S TRAVELS IN THAT COUNTRY

IT is a pleasing variety amid the more solid literature of this utilitarian age, to turn occasionally to those agreeable and unpretentious narratives which portrayed the position, opinions, and hopes of the European in India, sixty years since. Such accounts of our earliest introduction into these countries, have a value far beyond the mere interest they excite as books of travel or adventure. They give us an opportunity of comparing the great strides which civilization in her onward course is making in the gorgeous East,—and they afford testimony to the fact that the barrier of Eastern exclusiveness, prejudice and caste, is not altogether so formidable that it may not eventually be overthrown; while at the same time, they give no slight encouragement to the future, that in spite of the boasted immutability of heathen customs so perseveringly upheld by creed and habit, the fiat has gone forth to graft upon the effete and timeworn institutions of Hindustan, the civilization of the Western world. The stories of Eastern travel are very numerous, both in the Dutch, Portuguese, and English languages. One of the earliest perhaps in our own tongue is the fictitious narrative of Sir John Maundevile, and another is the lively and curious volume left us by Marco Polo; but their accounts are more marvellous than true. We may derive more profit and pleasure from the graphic tomes of Bernier, whose description of the Court of the Great Mogul; and the wild and wondrous scenes he was witness of, in those, the palmiest days of the princely city of Delhi, are well worthy of perusal. Other volumes of less note, but containing much valuable information about the particular territories where their authors sojourned or passed through, are also of considerable interest, even at the present day. Such are the travels of Thevenot, Terry, Grose, Tavernier, Hamilton, Valentyn, and other literary pioneers of Eastern voyages and adventure. We may perhaps afford to smile at some miraculous stories which their credulity accepted indiscriminately from their native narrators. But this is a weakness not quite obliterated in our own days, and we accept their labours, as those of honest and worthy travellers, who have left upon the whole faithful and interesting records of unanglicised India.

Among the minor authors whose works have not earned such a reputation as those above enumerated, but which are not the less valuable, is that of Fra Paolino de San Bartolomeo, a bare-footed Carmelite, who was thirteen years in India, and resided chiefly on the Malabar Coast, and who a great part of that time dwelt either in Travancore or the neighbouring territory of Cochin. During the course of his travels, he imparts much curious and interesting matter about those two countries. His work was originally written in Italian, and published after the return of the author to Europe at Rome, in 1796. Bartolomeo had much of his time occupied in missionary affairs in Travancore, which gave him an opportunity of describing the manner and customs of the people. This latter country lies in the remotest corner of Hindoostan, and includes a small strip of territory, between the ghauts and the sea, the extreme length from its northern boundary, to Cape Comorin, measuring about 174 miles ; its breadth averaging to about 48 miles ; and the total area amounting to a little more than 6,500 square miles. Of this, one-third consists of mountain land, and impenetrable forests uninhabitable by man, the remaining two-third only being available for cultivation.

Its natural scenery partakes of that singularly fresh and verdant character peculiar to the other parts of the Western coast. The heavy periodical rains prevailing with but slight intermission, for nine months in the year give birth to a profuse vegetation. The magnificent line of ghauts on its Eastern boundary is singularly beautiful and attractive, at times rising abruptly in bare and rocky peaks, and now covered from the foot to the summit with dense and pathless forests, and overhanging the low plains from the heights of 5,000 to 6,000 feet above the sea level. The Travancore group of mountains thus presents a striking analogy to the island of Ceylon in position and outline. The main chain runs eastward for 150 miles to Cape Comorin with occasional deep depressions, and terminates in a bold precipitous mass 3,000 to 4,000 feet high within three miles of the cape itself. The Travancore mountains are loftiest at the extreme north of the district, where they stretch east and west for sixty or seventy miles, separating the districts of Dindigul and Madura, and rising into peaks of 6,000 to 7,000 feet, which overhang the plains of Coimbatore ; and they retain an elevation of 5,000 to 6,000 feet, throughout their extent to the southward. They are generally very precipitous ; and undulating, or rounded grassy ridges seem to be of common occurrence at 6,000 to 7,000 feet. But one of the most important features in this country, and one which must add materially to its wealth and prosperity is the extensive backwater, the name given to an inlet from the sea, which runs in a direction parallel to the coast, and varying both in width and depth, and maintaining a course of nearly 175 miles from Trevandrum to Choughaut on the borders of the Cochin territories. The facilities here offered to water communication from one end of the country to the other, are incalculable ; and now that the only remaining obstacle is about to be overcome by piercing through an intervening belt of high land a mile or two long, a line of uninterrupted water transit will be opened from the extreme northern districts to the capital itself, and thence to Cape Comorin. The canals which have hitherto been dug in order to connect the backwater as one grand whole were completed many years since by an able and energetic Dewan, Vencatta Row, who projected and completed during his administration, two canals measuring in length upwards of seventeen miles, which including four bridges cost about two lacs of Rupees. These two canals bear the name of Her Highness the Ranee of Travancore, whose reign is still gratefully praised and remembered by her faithful subjects.

Of the actual history of the country, the following are a few brief outlines. In ancient times there reigned over the extensive kingdom of Malabar, a king renowned for his talents and virtues, and who was a just and beneficial ruler. His name was Cheruma Perumal, and previous to his death, which occurred after a reign of 48 years, he divided his country into four grand divisions of which Travancore was one. Like Charles V, the aged monarch, weary of the cares of state, retired to console his declining years, with religion and solitude, and taking up his abode within the precincts of a sacred pagoda in the Cochin territory, died full of years A. D. 352. A mussulman tradition relates that he became an apostate from the faith of his fathers, and, embracing mahomedanism, made a pilgrimage to Mecca, where he ended his days. The story rests probably upon no good foundation. But whatever may have been the fate of this king, the Malayalum empire terminated with his reign; and from that time there is a hiatus in Travancore history, over which many centuries have thrown the veil of obscurity.* Of the descendants of the famous Cheruma Perumal, we have but a bare list of the name of thirty-two sovereigns immediately preceding the present rajah. Of the acts or virtues of these royal worthies we possess but little or no information. In the 16th century the neighbouring province of Madura was a flourishing country, and Travancore was then a dependency on that State. And the earlier princes had their origin from Madura, whose Court was long considered both powerful and influential.

Their downfall may be dated from the incursion of the Mahrattas about the middle of the 18th century; at which time it is most likely that Travancore, taking advantage of the anarchy that prevailed in that state, separated itself from their dominion, and became an independent kingdom. At that time Palamcottah was a city belonging to the Travancore Government, though the boundary line has been considerably reduced since those days. In 1742, when Mahomed Ally khan ruled over the Madura and Tinnevelly provinces, and was in alliance with the English, he frequently made inroads into Travancore, for the purpose of exacting pecuniary supplies from the country. In these lawless transactions he was instigated by the English, who were then rapidly acquiring their indirect conquests over the southern provinces of the peninsula. The border district of Tovala was then the object of the rapine of the soldiers of Mahomed Ally’s army. It was through that district that they threatened more than once to push their unjust excursions; and at one period the minister of Travancore was glad to purchase their retreat by the payment of a large sum of money, professedly to be paid to the English Government. These may be considered the first transactions of the English with Travancore, at least to the southern portion of it.*

In 1755, Travancore became possessed of the tract of country lying to the east side of the ghauts, and extending from Cape Comorin to Calcaud; having purchased it from Moodemiah one of the race of those turbulent polygars who at that time over-ran the district of Tinnevelly. The possession of this slice of territory was productive of many disturbances between the troops of the Rajah of Travancore and those native chiefs who were dependent on, or in the actual pay of the English. The province of Tinnevelly was for long the scene of much petty warfare, and the reduction of the polygars and other independent chieftains who resided in those districts, gave frequent occupation to the British troops. The arrival of colonel Heron at Tinnevelly which took place soon after the Travancorians took possession of their new district, so alarmed the troops who were placed for its defence; that they abandoned the fortress of Calcaud, and left the neighbouring country to the mercy of the English, who despatching Maphuz Khan with a small force, soon reduced the inhabitants to subjection without any fighting. On the return, however, of the English to Trichinopoly, the Travancorians assisted by the Palitover of the district of Nellitangeville, attempted to retake the disputed district. Maphuz Khan having collected together a small force marched to meet them: an action took place near Calcaud—the troops of Maphuz Khan were defeated, and the Travancorians and their allies sat down before the fortress. But on hearing of the advance of Maphuz Khan with a fresh force, the Travancorians suddenly abandoned the siege, and returned to their own country. In September, however, of the same year, another fresh force marched from Travancore, defeated the troops before Calcaud and retook possession of the district. The inhabitants of these districts were repeatedly in the habit of making inroads into the Tinnevelly country for the purpose of seizing the harvest, and they would probably have incurred the displeasure of Mahomed Hoossein on this account, who was then at the head of all the forces in the Tinnevelly country, had not a dispute arisen between the Rajah of Travancore and the Polygar of Vedagherry, whose fortress was about fifteen miles north of the district of Shencottah, and thirty miles from Calcaud ; and whose subjects had made continued predatory excursions into the Travancore country through the Arungole pass. With the view of punishing the polygar, the rajah of Travancore made common cause with Mahomed Esoph, and at a conference held between them it was agreed that the rajah should not any longer permit his people to ravage the Tinnevelly country, and that they both should march a force to reduce the refractory polygar of Vedagherry. The combined forces assembled at Shencottah, the rajah of Travancore having brought from 10 to 12,000 men through the Arungole pass. An action ensued, which ended in the total defeat of the polygar, who escaped in the night, and became a fugitive in the neighbouring district of Palitover. Soon after this the rajah of Travancore demanded again the cession of the Calcaud districts from Mahomed Esoph, which after much hesitation were permanently made over to him,—the annexation being approved of by the English government. Another action which took place subsequent to the transaction was at Vashinellore, where the Travancorians and Mahomed Esoph having again united, they laid siege to that fortress ; after a series of attacks on both sides, the troops of the Palitover were victorious ; and Mahomed Esoph withdrawing his forces from the siege, the Travancorians also returned to their own country through the Arungole pass.

Previous to the military affairs which took place between the Travancorians and the English on this side, certain events occurred in the northern part of the kingdom, which in their results gradually extended the power and authority of the Rajah of Travancore.

About 1760, the kings of Cochin were still independent, and had several tributary princes scattered over the southern part of their territory ; among these was one called Cungaceri, and it was in 1764, that the Rajah of Travancore suddenly attacked his territories, defeated him and his allies in several decisive engagements : and then advanced to a place called Aricootty about 10 miles from Cochin, laid siege to, and took it, and having conquered the greater part of the country, and stripped the rajah of Cochin of two-thirds of his territory, bequeathed his newly won dominions to his nephew Ramah Vurmah, who ascended the musnud in the 24th year of his age. This Rajah's name was Vunjee Baula Rama Vurma Kolashayara Perumal, who appears to have been a more ambitious character, than his predecessor, and early gave signs of being affected by the grasping habit of annexation to the great annoyance and alarm of the neighbouring chieftains, who betrayed no relish for being absorbed by the more powerful state. But Vunjee Baula was a determined man whose lust of conquest was not to be thwarted by the lawful protests of his feudatory chiefs, and one by one the power of the latter became extinguished, and their countries annexed in due form. Even Cochin itself appeared to have been threatened by this unscrupulous prince. King Perumpadapil was then reigning at Cochin. But when these petty kings were subdued and deprived of their territories by the Commander-in-Chief of the king of Travancore, the celebrated Marthanda Pulla and his successor, general Eustachius de Lannoy, by birth a Fleming, a treaty was concluded with king Perumpadapil, in consequence of which he was left in possession of the few places above mentioned, as the last remains of royal dignity. This happened in the year 1761. (Bart p. 135—6.)

We must now follow Bartolomeo in the personal narrative of his adventures before proceeding with the history.—"I formed an acquaintance," he says, with M. de Lannoy at Carriapulli in the year 1777.* He drove Samuri on the other side of the river from Allangatta and Codumgalur; assigned a small spot to the king of Cochin for his support; made himself master of all the fortresses, put the king's troops on the same footing as the European; divided among them the conquered lands; caused them frequently to march through the country with full military parade in order to keep the people in subjection to their rulers, and after Vira Marthanda's death, gave the kingdom, in which perfect tranquillity was now restored, to the present sovereign Rama Varmer, who had just entered the twenty-fourth year of his age. Thus ended the dominion of the petty Malabar sovereigns; thus was humanity avenged, and thus were crimes punished, and the licentiousness suppressed, by which this country had been distracted ever since the tenth century. The military forces of the present king of Travancore consist of 50,000 men, disciplined according to the European manner, and 100,000 Malabar Nairs and Chegos, armed with bows and arrows, spears, swords and battle axes.

He keeps two valia sarwadi carryaearers, the vadakamugum, and the Tekmugum, one of whom is established on the north, and the other in the south. Each of these has under him four other officers, called only sarwadi carryaearers; these have inspection over four subalterns or carryaearer, and these subalterns have under them pravertheearer, ciandracerers, and toracerer; or collectors of the taxes, overseers and judges. The troops are always marching up and down, through the country to change their cantonments, to enforce the collection of the taxes, and to preserve peace and tranquillity. Public security is again restored throughout the whole country; robbery and murder are no longer heard of; no one has occasion to be afraid on the highways; religious worship is never interrupted; the people may rest assured, that on every occasion, justice will be speedily administered.

The present king has caused several canals to be constructed in order to unite different rivers with each other, and with the sea. By his desire also a very beautiful road has been completed between Cape Comorin, and Cudungallir, so that in the course of 24 hours he may be informed of every thing that takes place throughout his whole dominion. After deducting the expenses of government, his yearly income may amount to half a million of rupees, arising from trade, duties, and various kinds of fines. One half of this revenue is deposited in the royal treasury; and never touched, but in cases of the utmost necessity.

The king as well as all the other pagan Indians, the chief men even not excepted, live according to the manner of the Pythagoreans, and use no other food than rice, milk, fruits and herbs. He generally wears a turband of a dark blue silk, and long white robe fastened at the breast with a string of diamonds; long wide drawers of red silk, and shoes, the points of which are bent backwards, like those of the Chinese. A sabre is suspended from his shoulders; and in the blue girdle bound round his loins, is stuck a poniard or persian dagger, which can be used either for attack or defence. When he shows himself to the people in full state, he is attended by 5,000 or 6,000 men, together with a great number of palanquins and elephants. At the head of the procession is a band of musicians, and two court poets, who celebrate in songs his great achievements; he is borne in a palanquin, and the principal gentlemen of his Court must walk on each side of it. In my time he was very much attached to Catholic Missionaries. As often as he passed by the parsonage house at Anjengo, where I resided two years, he always sent two of the gentlemen of his bed-chamber to inquire after my health.”

During the course of his travels, Bartolomeo had several opportunities of becoming acquainted with the manners and customs of the people of Malayala, and his book contains accounts of several interesting interviews he had with the reigning prince of the country. Having procured letters of introduction from M. Adrian de Moens the Dutch Governor of Cochin, and Mr. John Forless, Governor of Anjengo, who both professed acquaintance with the Rajah; Bartolomeo set out from the former place for Trevandrum, on the 20th of June, 1780, previously acquainting the minister of his intended visit, the object of which was connected with certain missionary affairs, into which it is needless to enter, in this place. Taking with him according to established etiquette a few presents consisting of two European paintings, a large mirror, fifteen pounds of red sandal wood, and twelve bottles of Persian rose water, he arrived at the Court, when as he relates; “As soon as we made our appearance before the gate of the Castle, the guard presented his arms, and the minister sent a guide to conduct the persons who bore our palanquin to the door of the Palm-garden in which the King resided. Here our coolies or palanquin-bearers, were obliged to remain behind us, lest, being people of the lowest caste, they might contaminate the Royal-palace. At this door we were received by the King’s Commander-in-Chief, who conducted us through the Palm-garden, to a second door, where the King was waiting for us. He received us standing and surrounded by a great number of princes and officers. Near him stood his son, with a drawn sabre in his hand; in a shady place were three chairs, one of which was destined for the King, and the other two for me and my colleague. When we had all taken our seats, the attendants formed a circle around us. I then produced the Pope’s letter, which I had hitherto carried in a pocket-book richly embroidered according to the eastern manner; raised aloft, applying it to my forehead, in order to show my respect for the personage in whose name, I presented it, and delivered it to Sampradi Keshwapulla, the Secretary of State. The latter handed it to the King, who also raised it up, and held it to his forehead as a token of respect for his holiness. At the moment when the Pope's letter was delivered there was a general discharge of the cannon of the castle. * * *

" When the King had conversed for some time on various topics, he ordered his Minister and Secretary to give such an answer to our petition and such relief to our grievances which had been specified on an Ola, that we might return home perfectly satisfied and easy. For my part I could not help admiring the goodness of heart, affability, and humanity of this prince, as well as the simplicity of his household establishment and way of life. At that time, he and all the persons of his Court, according to the Malabar mode, had nothing on their bodies, but a small piece of cloth fastened round the loins, and the only mark of distinction by which royal dignity could be discovered, was a red velvet cap with gold fringes."

Highly gratified at so courteous a reception by the Rajah, Bartolomeo remained a few days at the capital, during which time His Highness appointed a Brahmin to serve him in the capacity of house-steward together with another official, who daily brought him a service of dishes prepared after the Malabar manner and which were paid for out of the Royal treasury. The Rajah evinced a great desire to become more familiarly acquainted with the English language, already speaking it exceedingly well. For this purpose he endeavoured to retain Bartolomeo a still longer time at his Court, but such a proceeding was by no means palatable to the Brahmins who did not relish the favour with which the European Missionary was being received, and they covertly procured his removal from the country. But the cause which Bartolomeo had at heart was neither stifled nor discouraged by this abrupt termination of his visit. He had acquired even during that short interview, some rights he claimed for his Christian flock, who were being treated with injustice by the native officials of the district; and he had a verbal assurance from the Rajah, that he would take under his protection the missionaries and Christians in general, who had been recommended to him by His Holiness.

Pope Clement the XIV, must have been rejoiced at the urbanity, and complaisance of a heathen prince. The next step was to send him out his own portrait, at the receipt of which the Rajah expressed the utmost satisfaction. The bearer of the papal gift received a douceur of 100 Rupees ; and Bartolomeo concludes cheerfully, with the hope that henceforth Christianity will acquire new strength, and be again raised to its former state of respectability.

The eighth chapter of the book is entirely devoted to missionary affairs ; the schisms and quarrels of both priests and people, besides some brief accounts of the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church practised in those parts. The chief disturbances appear to have risen on the side of the Cathanars, whom the Roman Catholic Church wished to bring into the bosom of its own Church. The Cathanars, for so are the Syrian priests called, are at all times a refractory set of persons, and the present race appears to keep up the same turbulent attitude towards foreign Christians as its predecessors. Talking of the clerical disturbances, Bartolomeo says, " they are to be ascribed chiefly to their Cassanars or priests ; for these men, who are both ignorant and proud, excite the people and encourage them to rebel against the Bishop and Missionaries. Had these native priests sufficient learning ; were they in any degree acquainted with their duty ; and did they know, how to procure from the Pagans the least respect, they might certainly be fit to be entrusted with the care of Christian congregations : but unfortunately they are strangers to these qualities, live like the irrational animals, and by these means, are the cause that their parishes are converted into dens of thieves. * * *

" These Cassanars were the cause also of the schism, which took place in 1653. In the year 1709, they had an intention of uniting themselves with the schismatic bishop. In 1773, they declared themselves under the jurisdiction of the Bishops of the Latin or Western Church : but in 1777, they sent a request to Rome, that they might be allowed to have bishops of their own nation. In the year 1787, they made themselves independent of the apostolic vicar ; but as I went to the Court of the king of Travancore, as well as to Cochin, in favor of the bishops and missionaries, the rebels were punished and again brought under subjection."

Bartolomeo reckons the number of Roman Catholics in his days in Malabar at 100,000, and alludes to conversion as progressing most rapidly. In two years (1780-81) he confirmed above 20,000 persons. In the census taken in 1854, there were 81,886 Romo-Syrians, 109,123 Syrians, 1,737 East Indians in Travancore alone. But these figures can hardly be depended on as giving a very correct return of the number of native converts. The Syrians it will be observed are the most numerous. Their history is full of interest. Impatient as ever of control or amalgamation with other Christian sects, they possess with all their ignorance and obduracy, a monument of vitality and progress strangely in contrast with other Christian sects. We see above how the Roman Catholics failed to bring them into their fold, and similar attempts by the Protestant missions have ended in equal failure. The first attempt at regenerating their Church, and bringing them back from the barbarism to which years of isolation and neglect had reduced them, was made at the time when Colonel Macaulay was British Resident of Travancore. It was then that the pious, noble-hearted, and energetic Buchanan strove to emancipate the fallen Syrians from that degradation and obscurity into which they had fallen.

These schismatics who lived in a place "five days' march through the woods which no European had yet visited," are the poor Syrians, and their locality,—described "as remote and situated in impenetrable forests where jungle fever and tigers abound," and before going to which Buchanan felt it prudent "to put his house in order,"—is the pleasant station of Cottayam, one of the most charming situations in the whole of Travancore. Here it was that Buchanan laid the basis of that intercourse with the Syrians that eventually resulted in their emancipation from the blind ignorance into which they had been so long precipitated. That the praise-worthy efforts to bring them over to the Protestant Church have in a measure failed, is not from want of any deficiency of zeal or perseverance on the part of those who embarked in so worthy a cause. All honour to those who strove so manfully in the cause of their fellow-creatures. It is more than consolation to feel that however short the aim may have fallen of its ultimate object, a vast deal of intelligence, education and moral good has been diffused among a stray flock, who before were wandering without a shepherd and sunk in indolence and sloth.

It was previous to Buchanan's [see his Christian Researches] visit that La Croze, a French Protestant, attempted to enquire into the state of the Syrian Churches in Travancore, and the result of his investigations will be found in his " Histoire du Christianisme des Indes," printed at La Hague, in 1724. A very ancient and admirable account of this long lost branch of the Church of Antioch may be seen in a small publication, entitled the " Syrian Church of India," written by Dr. Macbride and printed at Oxford, in 1856. We have not time here to enter upon its early History, but merely draw attention to its status in Travancore. " The kingdoms," says the author of this little pamphlet, " of Travancore and Cochin, in which they are settled, form a happy varied scene of hills covered with teak forests, and of rich vallies, which being well irrigated, retain even during the summer heats a perpetual verdure, and are suitable for rice cultivation. The range of southern ghauts separates this lovely landscape from the sandy plains of Tinnevelly, which produce scarcely any thing, but the tall branchless stems of the Palmyra tree. The peculiar feature of the country is the backwater, an inlet of the sea, which expands occasionally into a lake, and were it not for its marine hue, it might be mistaken for a river, being continually bordered by trees. In the strip of land between it and the open sea are Cochin and Allepie, populous towns, and Goa still magnificent in its ruins, the capital of the Portuguese Indian empire. Into this backwater fall the many rock streams that issue from the ghauts." The reader may form some idea of the scenery from the following description by Mr. Tucker of the prospect from the site of the new college. " The eye rests with delight upon all the luxuriance of the richest and most varied forms of foliage; the thick clustering bamboo, the stately mast-like stem of the areca palm, with the pepper plant, climbing up it like ivy; the cocoanut bending over the river with its waving plumes, the sago palm, and talipot, the cassia, the lofty buttress tree, the teak, with the mango and cashewnut, in their season scenting the whole air in the bright fresh early morning with their fragrant blossoms; the mountains in the distance, and the open space of hill and dale immediately before us, and the Cottayam river winding round, leave an impression on my mind of peaceful beauty, fertility, and repose which years of turmoil and occupation have been unable to efface. Below, by the river's side, is the old college, built under the direction of Colonel Munro, picturesque, but inconvenient. On the higher ground stands the new college built by the society, with its chapel, library, lecture rooms, and apartments, forming three sides of a quadrangle. Near is a missionary house, gothic church and school, and printing office. Behind, and where the river passes out of sight, among the trees, stands out the upper Syrian church, with its elevated chancel, and lower down, the second Syrian and Roman Catholic Churches." Here it was that the mission of Buchanan to bring into union the Syrian and Protestant Churches first commenced its operations. An interesting conversation took place between Buchanan and the Syrian bishop on the subject. The bishop arguing that he would sacrifice much for union, only he must not be called upon to compromise the dignity and purity of his Church. Discussions on various points ensued. It was fortunate that such men as Macaulay and Munro were in those days the British Residents at the Court of Travancore, for the Rajah was much inclined to promote the welfare of his Christian subjects, and the British plenipotentiaries brought their powerful influence in aid of the good cause. Arrangements were made with the sanction of the reigning prince, for erecting a college at Cottayam for the educational training of the Syrian youth, and with the view of aiding also in the religious, and moral education of the Cathanars. The Church Missionary society established Cottayam as one of their future Mission stations. With such fair and hopeful beginnings it is painful to reflect, how sadly the result fell short of the promise. A combination of unforeseen difficulties and mishaps destroyed those hopes once so justly indulged in. "Whether it was from excess of prudence in missionaries which degenerated into the fear of man, and prevented a full exhibition of spiritual truth, or from the inaptitude of the students to comprehend their teaching, certainly the experiment must be admitted to have been a failure; for during this long period exceeding thirty years, there has been I believe no visible improvement, and no spiritual life imparted to the Syrian Church, and not one of these hundred and fifty students have relinquished a single unspiritual tenet or superstitious custom."

* * *

"Thus suddenly and abruptly did a bigoted and imperious priest, incapable of comprehending the Christian love and long forbearance of the missionaries, and alike insensible to the spiritual and temporal interests of his people, check as far as in him lay, their social improvement and

their growth in grace. A division of the property was made by arbitration, under the direction of the resident; and the college has been removed to a neighbouring hill. The principal is resident, the students are no longer exposed to the influence of their bigoted native teachers, the services of the Church of England are alone performed and the mission is now understood as designed for all, whether heathen, or of the corrupt Syrian or Roman Church who desire to embrace our reformed scheme of Christianity."

Returning from this digression to the history of the country, we find that for upwards of twenty years Travancore appears to have enjoyed a state of repose and tranquillity, while a constant scene of warfare was going on in those countries bordering on her mountainous territories. It was not until the growing power of Tippoo had assumed an aspect at once threatening and formidable that the Rajah of Travancore felt the importance of that defensive alliance which during the last years had been contracted between himself and the English. It was not only the lust of conquest that instigated Tippoo to undertake hostilities against the Rajah, but his religious bigotry and intemperate zeal for the diffusion of his favorite creed, animated him in this, as well as in many of his other expeditions. Like all self-made conquerors too, the very stability of whose throne depends upon a succession of fresh conquests, and constant employment for their soldiery, he felt the absolute necessity of making his name and power felt and acknowledged over the whole south of India. The possession of Travancore would add to his empire and his glory; and without a shadow of right, he at once made his plans for an attack upon that kingdom which had hitherto maintained its neutrality and independence. A pretext for his invasion was soon discovered. Hyder had reduced to vassalage the kingdom of Cochin, and it so happened that in several places the Cochin territory was intersected by that of Travancore, especially in the northern parts. Tippoo complained that he was unable to reach his own territories without passing through that of a foreign power, a difficulty increased on account of a wall which had been erected on the frontier, and which by enclosing parts of both territories acted as an obstacle to his progress through his own dominions. He moreover questioned the right of the Travancorians to the fort of Cranganore, and Ayacottah which they had purchased from the Dutch, and finally he was irritated at finding that the country harboured numerous refugees who had fled from his persecution, and had sought an asylum amid the forests of this inaccessible country. With such flimsy pretences, Tippoo prepared for an invasion of the Rajah’s dominions, and refusing to listen to the mediation offered by the English Government, he hastened at once to throw a powerful army upon the barrier lines. At first the resistance was slight, owing chiefly to the long extent of wall which required to be defended; and Tippoo by a feigned attack having gained an easy entrance, pushed his troops along the inside of the barrier in order to guard the principal gateway. The Travancorians however made many efforts to arrest his progress, and bravely defended themselves against the overwhelming numbers of the enemy. The Sultan had more than once to supply his falling troops by re-inforcements from the rear: and some confusion arising from the imperfect manner in which those orders were executed, and from the increasing confidence and resolution of the Travancorians, the troops of the Sultan began to give way. A panic at last ensued, and the front ranks falling back upon those in the rear, the whole mass gave way; and an indescribable scene of dismay and confusion arose. Tippoo himself was wounded, and reluctantly borne away by the retreating masses of his soldiery. He reached his camp with difficulty, after losing about two thousand of his men; and leaving his palanquins and several other articles belonging to himself in the hands of the conquerors. But this glorious success of the Travancorians was not of long duration, Tippoo stung by defeat and disaster hastened to retrieve his honor by a fresh attack, and with a more powerful army. Collecting a strong force of artillery, he again appeared before the hated walls, the scene of his late humiliation: at the same time professing his desire of peace to the English Government. Towards the beginning of April he commenced breaching the walls, which could not sustain the shock of his batteries for any long time: and the Travancore soldiers finding further resistance hopeless against the numbers and valour of the Mysoreans, retreated from the place leaving the country to the mercy of the Sultan. The latter over-ran a great part of the country, committing his usual outrages against the defenceless inhabitants: nor was it until the heavy rain set in, that he was compelled at last to retire from his work of devastation; and, leaving his hoped-for subjugation of Travancore, to grapple with a foe whose hitherto unforeseen powers eventually brought him and his empire into one common ruin.

The departure of Tippoo and his licentious soldiery, appears to have been the signal for a series of internal commotions and petty disturbances, which for many years kept the state of Travancore in agitation and disquiet. It may not be difficult to trace the course of this to those habits of lawlessness which the Travancorean soldiery must have contracted from their contact with the Mysorean troops. A limited degree of control and authority would increase the insolence of a half-disciplined force, like that which had retreated from the victorious army of Tippoo, and history is not wanting in examples to show the danger arising to a state from the presence of an armed force, whom the pride of recent victory or the sting of humiliating defeat, impels to a course of wanton violence and unbounded crime. A rule at once despotic and arbitrary which could not so much control as direct the passions of this unruly multitude of semi-disciplined troops would be the only remedy for the growing troubles and discontent of the country. Rama Vurmah who ascended the musnud in 1799, did not possess the ability to grapple with these difficulties which beset his throne, and the Court itself became at an early period the scene of much strife and bloodshed. Several of his Dewans or ministers were removed by violence or death, the effect of partisan influence, and animosity; and it was only by the timely interference of the British resident that a stop was temporarily put to such unwarrantable proceedings. A slight interval of tranquillity was soon succeeded by fresh disturbances. Some real or pretended grievances were put forth by the rabble troops which surrounded the throne: a temporary concession to their demands served only to increase their insolence; and as they were instigated in their acts by parties hostile to British influence, they became emboldened by success, which they probably attributed to timidity on the part of the Government. That this was one of the causes of the open revolt which subsequently took place there can be little doubt: at all events it gave confidence to men whose minds were previously imbued with discontent, and affected with long misrule, and who were prepared to take advantage of the first opportunity which gave hopes of a change which might ameliorate, as they imagined, their own condition or subvert British authority. In the subsequent insurrection that burst forth and which openly set the British power at defiance; not only was the Dewan of Travancore deeply implicated, but even the Dewan of Cochin. Disputes at first arose between the Rajah and the Resident regarding the subsidy which had not been regularly paid by the Travancore state. On the side of the Rajah it was urged that the Company's troops entailed an additional burthen to the state which it was unable to bear; that the treaty of 1805, had in a measure been extorted from him, and that the state had not the means of defraying the subsidy. On the other hand the Resident denied the allegation regarding the treaty, and pointed out to the Rajah that the Carnatic Brigade, a body of useless half-disciplined soldiers, was one of the sources of great loss of revenue to the state; and an unnecessary burden; and ended in recommending its being at once disbanded. Believing the Dewan Vailoo Thumby to be the Rajah's chief adviser in these plots against British authority, the Resident insisted upon his removal—an act in which the minister professedly acquiesced, but in the meantime he secretly inflamed the minds of the populace, and attempted to bring about an insurrection, the aim and object of which should be the assassination of the British Resident. Reports having reached the latter of the disaffection which prevailed in the country, and various rumours of the rising of the whole people having got abroad, the Resident felt the necessity of summoning military aid without delay; and troops were immediately put in motion both from Trichinopoly and Malabar in order to quiet the rising insurrection. Anxious to strike a blow before the arrival of the Company's troops, the rumour of whose approach had now reached him, the Dewan on the night of the 28th of December, 1808, prepared in secret a party of armed men, who at his instigation, surrounded the house in Cochin where the Resident was then living. Aroused by their noise Colonel Macaulay appeared at the window when he was immediately fired at by the assassins, but happily without effect. Perceiving the danger which surrounded him he hastened to hide himself in a small room, pointed out to him by one of his own servants; which was undistinguishable from the outside; and here he remained concealed in safety during the whole night. Foiled in this atrocious attempt the assassins fled early next morning, their flight being somewhat hastened by the arrival of a vessel in the river, containing a portion of the troops which had been despatched from Malabar. On board this vessel Colonel Macaulay took refuge.

On the landing of the reinforcements the troops at once commenced offensive operations under the command of Colonel Chalmers then at the head of the force at Quilon. Proceeding to Paroor, a town midway between Quilon and Trevandrum, he made a successful attempt to dislodge the enemy from that situation. The Nairs though far exceeding in numbers the handful of British troops, fled in confusion, leaving several guns behind them. Soon after this, information was received that large bodies of the enemy, one from the north, and the other from the south, were marching rapidly towards the scene of the late contest, and Colonel Chalmers therefore deemed it prudent to withdraw into the cantonment at Quilon, and remain upon the defensive, until further reinforcements should join him.

Fresh troops having accordingly arrived early in January, Colonel Chalmers moved out to attack the enemy, which was commanded by the Dewan in person, and which amounting to about 30,000 men with 18 guns, was advancing towards Quilon by rapid marches. The engagement was of short duration; in less than five hours the insurgents were totally defeated, leaving nearly all their Artillery, and a large number of slain on the ground.

Not discouraged by this failure, the Dewan turned his face towards Cochin, and investing that place, he made a vigorous attack by three separate columns. The small garrison commanded by Major Hewitt and which was composed of eight Companies of the 12th and 17th Madras Native Infantry, bravely defended the fort, and compelled the masses of the Dewan's soldiery to retire, with considerable loss, yet not without much severe and obstinate fighting; thus foiled in their attempt the insurgents raised the blockade, and retreated again towards the south.

The aspect of affairs now called for a more vigorous interference on the part of the English Government. A fresh force was at once raised and directed to proceed to the southernmost portion of the Peninsula, in order to effect an entrance into Travancore through the pass of Arambooly, which was fortified by means of several redoubts, mounting two or three guns east and connected with a wall extending north to south for about two or three miles. These barriers were never very formidable and could never have long resisted the attacks of regular and disciplined troops.

The new force was commanded by Colonel St. Leger who arrived at the foot of the pass early in January. He determined to carry the place by surprise, especially as he was unaccompanied with a battering train. A night attack was resolved on, and Major Welsh being entrusted with its execution, the plan was in every way successful, and before day-break next morning, the bastions were in the hands of the British, and the pass secured.

This vigorous and successful operation, led to the entire abandonment by the enemy of their defensive works in that quarter. Speedily following up this blow, Colonel St. Leger marched to Nagercoil, overcame a small body of troops posted to defend the passage of the river at that place; and finally sat down before Oodeagherry and Pulpunapooram, two forts in close proximity, at the foot of a small detached hill called the Vaily Mullay. The garrison of these fortresses did not wait for an attack, but fled abandoning their work, and their examples were followed by the insurgents in every direction. In the meantime the troops at Quilon, had again defeated the Nairs in a brilliant engagement under Colonels Picton and Stuart, who dispersed and utterly disorganised the rebel forces, and captured all their artillery. The British forces now being able to communicate with each other, gradually converged towards the capital. The Dewan fled to the jungles, and the Rajah alarmed at their near approach hastened to tender his submission to the British resident.

An interview was now held between the Rajah and the Resident, and by the conditions of a new treaty it was agreed that the Travancore Government should pay all arrears of the subsidy and the expense of the war; that the Carnatic brigade should be dissolved, and that the defence of the country should be hereafter entrusted to a subsidiary force, part of which was to be stationed at Trevandrum. Peace being then restored, the force was broken up, and the troops returned to their cantonments. A miserable fate awaited the Dewan; pursued from place to place, he lingered out a wretched existence among the mountain fastnesses, till at last his retreat being discovered, he was put to death by his own brother, or, some say, committed suicide to avoid his capture. His brother was seized and publicly executed at Quilon, while the corpse of the Dewan himself was conveyed to Trevandrum, and exposed to the insults of the populace,—a revengeful and unworthy act which most justly called down the severe animadversion of the Supreme Government. By the fifth article of the treaty between the British Government and the State of Travancore drawn up in 1805, it was specifically provided that in case of the subsidy agreed upon to be annually paid to the former, falling in arrears, the British Government should be empowered to assume the management of the country. More than once had this treaty been broken; and on this occasion, the British Government proceeded (seeing no immediate remedy for the existing state of affairs) to carry into execution the new arrangement. At the time, Colonel J. Munro was appointed Resident—and he was at once authorized to assume the office of Dewan, and undertake the administration of the country: and this at the request, according to his own statement, of the Rajah himself The measures he adopted were eminently calculated to restore the public tranquillity; and from an exhausted exchequer, a lamentable deficiency in the administration and want of justice, he succeeded not only in relieving the country of its debts, but in completely raising the finances to a state of more than their usual prosperity. Every department was re-organized, and most of the severe and burdensome taxes were lightened and repealed, and a foundation of order and quiet established throughout the country, which has never since been interrupted. It was not till the year 1814, that Colonel Munro, resigned his power as Dewan of the country. In the meantime, the Rajah had died, and had been succeeded by the Ranee, his sister: after a brief reign of 2 years, she was again succeeded by her sister, who assumed the regency of the country, till the youthful Rajah had attained his majority in 1829. This latter prince, after a reign of 18 years, was succeeded by Rajah Marthanda Vurmah, in 1846.

It may readily be supposed that a country like Travancore affords ample field for the researches of the botanist, and this is undoubtedly the case. Frequent as have been the explorers on the western coast in Canara, Malabar and Coorg, the high lands of Travancore and Cochin, have seldom been visited by the botanical traveller; and although, the larger portion of the Flora partakes of a character, resembling that of the neighbouring district; yet it is not improbable that some plants now considered peculiar to Ceylon, may be found on these mountains. Whatever may have been the faults of the administration of the Dutch East India Company, it is certain that they have at least the redeeming qualities of not having neglected to promote the study of science, and the development of the national resources of the countries they settled in. Few subjects are deserving of greater attention than those which derive their value from being connected with the comforts and necessaries of human life. And the most attractive of all sciences, are those which lead in their results from every fresh discovery or application of principle to a permanent benefit in behalf of mankind. Among such we may look upon botany as taking the highest rank, and it is to the lasting praise of the Dutch, that their labours in the cause of science in India, were so zealous, and which entitle them to be ranked as the first pioneers in this field.

Bartolomeo devotes the whole of his eleventh chapter to the subject of the medicine and botany of this country. "India alone," he says, "contains more medical writings, perhaps, than are to be found in all the rest of the world. As printing has never been introduced here, all hands are employed in copying manuscripts, and particularly such as relate to the prolongation of human life, viz., medical and botanical. Those who wish to be convinced of the multitude of articles that occur in the medicine and botany of Malabar, need only recur to the work published at Amsterdam, in the year 1689, under the title of "Hortus Malabaricus." Both these sciences were cultivated in India, above three thousand years ago, and at present give employment to a great number of people. When a physician is sent for, you are sure to be visited by five or six. There are even boys, who possess an extensive knowledge of botany, and this is not surprising, as, from their earliest years, they are made acquainted with the nature of plants, and their different properties." To these remarks, succeed a catalogue of several medicinal plants, with their uses and properties, together with the vernacular names; and which, according to his own account, cost him an immense labour to collect. But he must have been greatly indebted to the industry of his Dutch predecessors, who a century before his time had been collecting plants, and illustrating with indefatigable labour the Flora of this coast.

Foremost in the ranks of these early Dutch botanists stands the name of the indefatigable Henricus Van Rheede, Governor of Cochin, who laid the whole country under contribution for his unequalled work in 12 folio volumes on the plants of the Western Coast. "The Hortus Malabaricus," says Evelyn “presents us with the most stupendous and unheard of plants in that elaborate work: the cuts being in copper, and certainly of any published the most accurate done, nor are they in their shape and description less surprising. [Evel. corresp. 1681]. In this work are contained 794 plates so accurately figured, that there is no difficulty whatever in identifying them. Then followed Rumphius, a Hanoverian, whose “Herbarium Amboinense” occupies six quarto volumes with nearly 780 plates. Hermann, whose labours were confined to Ceylon, his Museum Zeylanicum having been published in 1717, and his Flora Zeylanica in 1747, the two Burmanns, father and son, whose ‘Flora Indica’ and ‘Flora Zeylanica’ respectively are valuable repertories of Indian botanical knowledge. Kœnig was a Dane, Commelin, Klein, and Rottler were either Dutch or German. All honor then to the Hollanders who first laid the foundation of that edifice which the subsequent labours of Roxburgh, Wallich and Wight, have well nigh completed in the present century. Subsequent researches have rendered Bartolomeo’s list of plants any thing but novel or valuable, though he says it cost him immense labour to collect the numerous catalogue of samples and to add their Malabar, Latin and Portuguese names. “The sources I employed,” he says, “besides my own experience, are the dictionaries of Hanxleden, Viscoping and Pimental; the herbarium of Father Fraz and a M.S. containing observations by many regular physicians and botanists, natives of the coast of Malabar.” Whatever may be the value of the learned treatises above referred to, we fear they are inaccessible to the student of the present day, who must content himself with mere recent and no doubt worthier books on the Flora of Malabar. The climate of Travancore is the same as in other parts of Malabar, and the following remarks by one of the most eminent of modern botanists* may be applied to this country. “From the humid character of the Malabar climate, its luxuriant vegetation might be inferred. Hamilton tells us that it resembles Bengal in verdure, but has loftier trees and more palms: the shores are skirted with cocoanuts, and the villages surrounded with groves of betelnut, palms and talipots. Vateria Indica, a noble dipterocarpous tree, is abundantly planted in many parts; cassia, pepper and cardamoms flourish wild in the jungles, and form staple products for export. The fact that the pepper is cultivated without the screens used in other parts of India, to preserve a humid atmosphere about it, is the best proof of the dampness, and equability of the climate. The low valleys are richly clothed with rice-fields, and the hill sides with millets, and other dry crops, whilst the gorges and slopes of the loftier mountains are covered with a dense and luxuriant forest.

The mass of the Flora is Malayan, and identical with that of Ceylon, and many of the spices are further common to the Khasya hills, and the base of the Himalaya. Teak is found abundantly in the forests, but the sandalwood occurs only on the east and dry flanks of the chain. Oaks and coniferæ are wholly unknown in Malabar, but the common Bengal willow (*Salix tetrasperma*) grows on the hills. Gnetum and Cycas both occur, the former abundantly.

Of the deep depressions that intersect the Travancore range, and by which communications are kept up between the districts which it divides, that of Courtalum, in 9 degrees of north latitude, is a well-known botanical station, which, though on the eastern or Carnatic side, from its peculiar form and situation is under the influence of the southwest monsoon, and enjoys, together with the rest of the province, a deliciously cool and equable climate. Notwithstanding the perennial humidity, the rain-fall at Courtalum is only 40 inches; on the hills around, however, it is doubtless much greater. The Pulney or Pulnai mountains west of Dindigul, the Animalaya south of Coimbatore, the Shevaghiri mountains southwest of Madura, and the ranges near Courtalum, are all well-known as the scenes of Dr. Wight's indefatigable labours, which in this direction have extended to Cape Comorin itself.

There are few botanical features of Travancore not common to both Ceylon and Malabar in general. Nutmegs, coffee, and cinnamon flourish at Courtalum. The remarkable palm, Bentinckia, so common on its mountains, is however not known in Ceylon. The other palms are Caryota urens, an Areca, Phœnix farinifera, and one or two species of Calamus. The products of the forests are brought down at the proper season to the commercial depôt of the country at Allepie, a place which promises to be one of the most thriving and busy ports on the western coast. It is remarkable for the existence of an extraordinary bank of mud which is thrown up by some natural means in the open roadstead forming a complete breakwater, and thereby affording a safe refuge for vessels at all seasons of the year.

Perhaps few places in Travancore are of greater interest if referred to byegone times than Anjengo, which was for many years, an English factory, now a ruin in a deserted locality. Those who are intimate with the attractive "Oriental Memoirs of Forbes," will recollect the lively description of a station where he passed so many of his days. Orme, the celebrated Historian was born here, and here lived Elizabeth Draper to whom Sterne addressed the famous "Letters to Eliza." A tombstone in the churchyard, records the burial here of the first British resident Jno. Toller, A. D. 1777.

Fifty years' continued tranquillity has doubtless conferred many great benefits on Travancore, and the naturally quiet disposition of the people has been perhaps as instrumental, as any other cause in leading them to enjoy, and appreciate the blessings of peace. The rapid spread of education among all classes, which has swept away many prejudices, and opened the paths of civilization to the people, has been the happy consequence of their long intercourse with Europeans. During several preceding reigns, the Rajahs appear to have been sensible of the advantages accruing to a more extended diffusion of knowledge among their subjects; and the Free School of Trevandrum has long maintained for itself a reputation, as one of the best institutions for the education of native youth in South India. With every advantage for communication with foreign countries, the march of improvement must steadily progress in this beautiful country; and a faithful and firm alliance with the British Government must be productive of that increasing prosperity it so richly deserves.

NOTE.—The following Extracts from Dr. Buchanan's letters to his friends on the subject of the Syrian Churches are so interesting that they deserve to be quoted in this place.

"The interesting scenes of the Christian Missions have lately obliterated from my mind the poor Syrians and Jews, although I am just on their borders; and being on the borders, I can get no information about them from the European. Every body refers me to Colonel Macaulay. I have read in French, since I left Pondicherry, La Croze's Christianity in India, a most admirable classical work. His chief subject is the inquisition at Goa, and the Syrian Christians; and his last pages are devoted to Ziegenbalg. He expresses a hope that some persons will be sent from Europe on an embassy to the Syrian Christians, to enquire concerning their state, learning, and religion after so long an interval.

"Joachim at Anghoor told me I should find them in five days' march through the woods from Travancore palace; he called them schismatiques, whom no European or Romish priest had ever visited.

Again, "From Trevandrum I went to Poontara on the sea-coast; and here I first saw a Syrian Church in the Romish communion. I mean in Travancore; for I before mentioned to you that I had visited one near Trichinopoly. From Poontara to Anjengo I travelled by the sea-coast, and had the pleasure to see a Church every four or five miles. From Cape Comorin to Cochin, there are about a hundred Churches on the sea-shore alone. Of these, the chief part are the Syrian Latin, or more properly the Syrian Romish Churches. The priest reads the Syriac Liturgy, not one word of which the people understand, and then he walks off; or he reads the Latin Liturgy with which the poor Christians are equally edified. Some of them (the private Christains) have, however, the prayers translated into Malayalim. The churches are snow white, and are generally built in a grove of shady trees. Before each, on the sand of the shore, is a lofty cross; which like the church itself, is conspicuous at a great distance.

At Quilon, Dr. M., nephew to the Colonel, entertained me. The subsidiary force is at present encamped here. At this place I saw Dr. H., the Hindostanee scholar. He told me, that though he had been many months here, he had not yet met with any one, who can give an account of the schismatic Syrians, as their Churches were all in the interior, where Europeans cannot go without the permission from the Rajah.

I am now about to proceed Northward and Eastward from this place to visit the Syrian Churches. There is one very near to Mavelicar. The others are remote, situated (according to Dr. L.'s account) in impenetrable forests where jungle fevers and tigers abound.

The weather is dry and clear, and I have received a very different account of the regions I wish to visit. I shall however proceed no further than may be prudent. I have told my servants, that they may remain behind if they please. But they choose to accompany me. The Rajah's men encourage them. The Lord, who hath graciously led me from Cambuslang to Calcutta, and from Calcutta to Cape Comorin, will lead me in safety, I trust, through the mountains of Travancore. In many instances already, mountains have been made a plain before me; and I am ready to believe, that some good will result from a journey, hitherto so remarkably favoured by providence.

I think it right, however, 'to put my house in order' at this place, and leave the event to him, who disposes of the lives of his servants according to his eternal purposes and righteous will."

Cochin, 5th December, 1806.

My last letter from Travancore informed you that I was about to leave the sea-coast, and proceed into the interior of the country to visit the ancient Syrian Churches. I have been enabled to accomplish my purpose. I have visited the remote Churches, situated amongst the hills at the bottom of great ghauts. The scenery of the country was everywhere delightful; the weather was cool and pleasant, and I have returned from an expedition, which was represented to be dangerous, in perfect health.

Cochin, 24th December, 1806.

Dear Sir,

In August or September last, I addressed a letter to you from the pagoda of Seringham, near Trichinopoly. Since that period I have visited Ceylon, and many places in Southern Coromandel, and in the province of Malabar. I passed a week at the palace of the Rajah of Travancore, who aids me very liberally in all my pursuits. The brahmins and present minister had taught the young man (he is only twenty-five) to oppress the Christians. But he promises milder treatment in future.

This favourable change is produced by the exertions of Colonel Macaulay, the Resident, who, I am happy to say, is much alive to the interests of religion.

From the sea-coast I proceed to the interior of the country, to visit the ancient Syrian Christians who inhabit the hills, at the bottom of the great mountains of Malayalim. The weather was cool and pleasant. The country is picturesque and highly cultivated, diversified with hill and dale, and winding streams. These streams fall from the mountains and preserve the vallies in perpetual verdure. The Christians received me courteously, seeing I travelled in some state escorted by the Rajah's servants.

Their doctrines are not in essentials at variance with those of the Church of England They desire a union, or at least such a connection as may be practicable or desirable for the better advancement of the interests of Chritianity in India.

[^*]: Another account of this tradition is as follows :—When Parashuramen was performing penance on the mountain Mahandra, where, after having gained twenty-one victories over the Kchettries, he had laid up all his arms, the chief munees or saints came to see him, and, having saluted him, advised him to cause the sea to recede, and to bring to light the land of Kerala, which had been submerged under the ocean in a former age. Parashuramen immediately went to the neighbourhood of Gokarnam and hurling an axe, recovered the land from the sea as far as to where the weapon fell. The limits are Cape Comorin on one side, and Gokarnam on the other. There are three divisions, that of Kerala, Tulu, and Heiga. From Cape Comorin to the river Kanyirota is the Kerala division. The middle portion from thence is the Tulu division. The last part is the Heiga division, the boundary of which is the river Bashpasetu. These three divisions embrace what is now called Mayalim. Parashuramen having thus created the land of Kerala, summoned the Brahmins from a foreign country, and made over the country to them, and giving chief authority to them over the employments and occupations of the four castes, namely, the Brahmin, the Kchettry, Veishya and the Sudra, he rested from his work.—H.

[^*]: The author alludes to the goitre or bronchocele. The classical reader will recollect the line in Juvenal (Sat. xiii. 162.) Quis tumidum guttur miratur in Alpibus? The sufferers were called 'Gutturosi.' It was formerly supposed that this glandular swelling only appeared in certain countries, such as Switzerland and Savoy, and that its origin arose from drinking snow water. It is however found in certain districts of South America, Sumatra, and even in Great Britain, especially in Derbyshire, from whence it has been called the "Derbyshire-Neck." Its origin is very obscure, but as it prevails in countries, both where snow exists and where it does not, drinking snow-water can no longer be asserted as the cause of its appearance.—H. D.
[^†]: Elephantiasis or Cochin Leg. This prevails to a great extent among the inhabitants of the Western Coast ; nor has any certain remedy hitherto been discovered for the diseased part, short of amputation. It is more than probable that bad water and bad diet, are the remote causes of it.—H. D.
[^*]: Hailstorms have occasionally occurred in these districts, though they are of very rare occurrence. One of unusual severity occurred only last month (April 1862) in the town of Cochin itself.—H. D.
[^†]: A knowledge of the monsoons may be traced from very early ages. Humboldt says that Alexander's companions were not ignorant of the existence of the monsoons, by which navigation was so greatly favoured between the Eastern Coasts of Africa and the North and Western parts of India. After having spent ten months in navigating the Indus between Nicæa on the Hydaspes and Pattala, with a view of opening the river to a universal traffic, Nearchus hastened to sail from Stura, at the mouth of the Indus at the beginning of October; since he knew that his passage would be favoured by the N. E. and Eastern Monsoons in the same parallel of latitude. The knowledge of this remarkable local direction of the winds, subsequently emboldened navigators to attempt to sail from Ocelis on the Straits of Babelmandeb, cross the open sea to Muziris (south of Mangalore) the great Malabar emporium of trade, to which products from the Eastern shores of the Indian peninsula, and even gold from the distant Chryse (Borneo?) were brought by inland trade.—(Cosmos.)
[^*]: In John Nieuhoff's "Remarkable Voyages and Travels into the best provinces of the West and East Indies," we find the following description of Cochin, under the date 1662.—"Some authors make mention of two different Cochins, viz.: the old Cochin, lying about a league and a half from the sea-shore. The Portuguese call it *Cochin Daçima*, or Higher Cochin, because it lies higher up the river; by the Dutch it is called *Cochin Malabar*, where the king keeps his residence, being situated upon the banks of a river, and pretty well peopled and adorned with several goodly structures and pagodas. The other, called New Cochin, is scarcely a league from the sea, and was in the possession of the Portuguese."—(TRANS.)
[^†]: Cochin is a sea-coast town, the capital of the principality of that name. In the Malayala language it is called Cocci: deriving its name from a small river which formerly emptied itself there into the sea. In the year 1341, the sea
[^*]: Mud Bay or Muddy Bay, is the commercial port of Alleppie in the kingdom of Travancore, 36 miles south of Cochin, remarkable for the singular natural break-water formed in the open sea, consisting of a long and wide bank of mud, the effect of which is so completely to break the waves, that ships of all sizes can securely anchor even at the stormiest season of the year in the open roads, where the water is perfectly calm. The origin of this deposition of mud, has never been satisfactorily accounted for. It imparts a dirty colour to the water and makes it thick and slimy. It has shifted more or less within the last century, but not to any great extent. A similar deposit exists at Narrakul about 20 miles north of Cochin, and the advantage of this latter place, as a natural open harbour for shipping, has recently been brought to the notice of the British Government.—H. D.
[^†]: The well-known city of Calicut, which has experienced such a variegated fate, lies on the sea-coast, in the latitude of 11° 15′ north. It consists partly of houses constructed of teakwood, and partly of huts composed of palm branches interwoven through each other, and covered with palm leaves. Of stone buildings there are very few. The fortress of Calicut is of much greater antiquity than the city to which it has given its name. The natives of Malabar believe that it was built by *Cheramperumàl* from whom all the petty Malabar princes are descended. This city was raised almost to the ground by Tippoo Sultan, who destroyed its flourishing trade; expelled from the country the merchants and factors of the foreign commercial houses; caused all the cocoa-nut and sandal trees to be cut down; and ordered the pepper plants in the whole surrounding district to be torn up by the roots, and even to be hacked to pieces, because these plants, as he said, brought riches to the Europeans and enabled them to carry on war against the Indians.—*Bartolomeo's Voyage to the East Indies*.
[^*]: Collam, Coilon, Coulon or Quilon, signifies, in Malayalim, a tank. It was built, A. D. 825; and was at one time a place of considerable importance. The natives of the country begin their era from its foundation, in the same manner as the natives of Cochin begin theirs from the origin of the island of Vaipeen. In former days there were a great many weaving-looms, and manufactures of cotton and stoneware here. Alexius Menezes, the first Archbishop of Goa, built an excellent fortress here, which afterwards fell into ruins, being neglected by the Dutch.—H. D.
* The following account of this transaction is given by Captain Alexander Hamilton, who travelled among the East Indies between the years 1688 and 1723. "The Dutch were building the fort of Chetwa, and the Zamorin got "some of his men under the disguise of labourers to be employed by them, "and to take an opportunity of surprising the Dutch. The two lieutenants "who had the overseeing of the work were one evening diverting themselves "with a game at tables in a guard room about half a mile from the fort. "They had let some of their soldiers go straggling about, and the disguised "natives took the opportunity to kill the sentinels, signal to the ambuscade, "and take the half built fort. One of the lieutenants in attempting to retake "it was killed; the other, thinking it impracticable to attack greater forces "within than he had without, embarked for Cochin with his men. I was for- "tuned to be at Cochin when he and his men arrived, and by a Court Martial "he was sentenced to be shot, which sentence I saw executed. The Zamorin "caused the English flag to be hoisted, and the fort was destroyed."—TRANS.

This city is of great antiquity, and the kings of Collatiri belong to the first class of the Indian princes * * *"

The capital of the kingdom of Cananore, called also Colanada, lies in the latitude of 11° 50', and is distinguished by the same name. The whole surrounding district, which extends towards the north, as far as Mount Delly, is inhabited by the *Molandis*, who live merely by piracy. These sea-robbers are mentioned by Pliny, Arrian, Ptolemy, and other ancient authors. They unite themselves to other pirates, who reside on the Angedib islands, near Goa, and capture all the small vessels, which sail from Goa to Cochin. The huts in which their wives and children live, stand on the eastern side of Mount Delly. This mountain, which forms a cape or head-land, lies in the latitude of 12° 5'; and here Malabar or Malayala, properly so called, ends."—*Voyage to E. Indies.*

* In 1602 the Dutch East India Company was formed by the amalgamation of several different companies into one united body. The members were invested with authority to conclude peace or make war with Oriental potentates, to build forts and garrison them according to discretion. For many years this new Company acquired considerable authority and power in the East. Its commercial relations were very extensive, and for its better protection the Company despatched a fleet of fourteen vessels, as a support to their numerous colonies. It was not long before they came in contact with their jealous rivals the Portuguese, and the hostile fleets of both nations frequently encountered each other in the Indian seas. It was not till after many conflicts that the superiority of the Dutch was maintained. In less than half a century they had taken or destroyed upwards of 300 Portuguese vessels, and thus made themselves masters of the sea. Upon the destruction of the maritime power of the Portuguese, the Dutch found no difficulty in attacking and capturing their settlements on land, and the booty of military stores and ammunition which they seized in their several conquests, turned greatly to their advantage, as the magazines and fortresses contained everything necessary both for themselves and the prosecution of their commercial projects. Such was the origin of the great prosperity of the Dutch East India Company. Last, after the lapse of a hundred and fifty years, the Company began to decline owing to many concurring circumstances, chiefly from the speculation and avarice of the Government and merchants, and partially from the innumerable wars in which they became engaged. Settlement after settlement becoming a prey to internal faction, or the attack of the natives, fell from their grasp, and the English soon supplanted a power which was unable to maintain itself either by land or sea.—H.

[^*]: Kaabeljancos and Flocks, two parties which in the 14th and 15th centuries divided and agitated the whole population of Holland and Zealand. The origin of this burlesque denomination was a dispute between two parties at a feast, as to whether the codfish took the hook, or the hook the codfish? This was made the pretext for a serious quarrel, and the partisans of the towns and of the nobles ranged themselves on either side, the former, the flocks, wore red caps and the latter, the Kaabeljancos, grey ones. Jacqueline of Holland was supported by the former in her quarrel with Philip of Burgundy, and in the year 1492 the extinction of that faction struck a final blow to the dissension.

NOTE.—The East Indian community which is here alluded to has undoubtedly undergone a great change since the days of our Author, consisting of numerous families in all parts of the country most of whom are of high respectability and usefulness. The term Topass has fallen into disuse, but it is singular enough that to the present day, the Europeans in India invariably call ‘boy’ whenever they require their servant, East Indian or Native. H. D.
[^*]: According to other accounts Tupasi is derived from the Sanscrit word *Duibhashi*. *Dui* signifies two, and *Bhashi* a man who speaks two languages; an interpreter. This name, indeed, may with propriety be given to the Tupasi; for besides their mother tongue, they speak some one of the European languages, either English, French, Dutch or Portuguese. At Cochin they are called *Gens de Chapeau*, because they wear a Topi or small hat; whereas the other Indians, not descended from Europeans, make use of the *Romali*, that is, a white turband of the finest muslin.—BARTOLOMEO.
[^*]: “It is probable that a great part of the Christians of St. Thomas in India came from Persia or Chaldea. The rites, liturgy, ceremonies and books of these Christians, bear evident marks of a Chaldaic or Persian extraction. Though the Malabar dialect is at present the mother tongue of the Christians of St. Thomas in India, they, however, employ Chaldaic phrases when they speak of sacred and religious objects. It is, therefore, not improbable, that a considerable number of Christians went from Persia and Chaldea to India, and united themselves to the small body of the original Indian Christians, whose ancestors were formerly converted to the Christian faith by the Apostle Thomas at Mailapuri, which they unanimously consider as the place that first gave birth to Christianity in India. This much is certain, that all these Christians in the year 1502, at which period Vasco de Gama came a second time to Malabar, were Nestorians. Some of them denied the divinity of Christ, and could not endure images; but, on the other hand, they showed a greater reverence for the holy cross. They had no other Sacraments than Baptism, the Last Supper, and the Consecration of Priests. They believed that the souls of the just were not admitted into the presence of God before the final judgment, and that till that period they were to remain in Eden. In the year 1599, these Christians, by the exertions of Alexis Menesez, Archbishop of Goa, were united to the Catholic Church. As some customs of the oriental Churches, were, however, introduced among them in the Council at Udiamper, and as they by degrees found the arbitrary conduct of the Portuguese insupportable, they raised a violent outcry against them; and in a tumultuary congress, held on the 22nd of May, 1653, at Alangatta, at length formally separated from the Catholic Church.”—BARTOLOMEO’S East Indies.
[^*]: The tradition of St. Thomas having preached the gospel in India is thus related by Gibbon (C. 47). "According to the legend of antiquity, the gospel was preached in India by St. Thomas. At the end of the ninth century, his shrine, perhaps in the neighbourhood of Madras, was devoutly visited by the ambassadors of Alfred, and their return with a cargo of pearls and spices rewarded the zeal of the English monarch, who entertained the largest projects of trade and discovery. When the Portuguese first opened the navigation to India, the Christians of St. Thomas had been seated for ages on the Coast of Malabar, and the difference of their character and colour attested the mixture of a foreign race. In arms, in arts, and possibly in virtue, they excelled the natives of Hindoostan: the husbandmen cultivated the palm-tree, the merchants were enriched by the pepper trade, the soldiers preceded the Nairs or nobles of Malabar, and their hereditary privileges were respected by the gratitude or the fear of the king of Cochin and the Zamorin himself. They acknowledged a Gentoo sovereign, but they were governed even in temporal concerns, by the Bishop of Angamala. He still asserted his ancient title of metropolitan of India, but his real jurisdiction was exercised in fourteen hundred Churches, and he was entrusted with the care of two hundred thousand souls. Their religion would have rendered them the firmest and most cordial allies of the Portuguese, but the inquisitors soon discerned in the Christians of St. Thomas the unpardonable guilt of heresy and schism. Instead of owning themselves the subjects of the Roman pontiff, the spiritual and temporal monarch of the globe, they adhered, like their ancestors, to the communion of the Nestorian patriarch; and the Bishops whom he ordained at Mosul, traversed the dangers of the sea and land to reach their diocese on the coast of Malabar. In their Syriac liturgy, the names of Theodore and Nestorius were piously commemorated; they united their adoration of the two persons of Christ; the title of Mother of God was offensive to their ear, and they measured with scrupulous avarice the honours of the Virgin Mary, whom the superstition of the Latins had *almost* exalted to the rank of a goddess. When her image was first presented to the disciples of St. Thomas, they indignantly exclaimed, "We are Christians, not idolators!" and their simple devotion was content with the veneration of the cross. Their separation from the western world, had left them in ignorance of the improvements, or corruptions, of a thousand years; and their conformity with the faith and practice of the fifth century, would equally disappoint the prejudices of a papist or a protestant. It was the first care of the ministers of Rome to intercept all correspondence with the
* The Colony of white Jews residing apart in the midst of the native population is a very remarkable fact. Their number at present is about 300. They are very poor. According to their own statement, their ancestors were refugees from Palestine A. D. 68; when 10,000 Jewish families came and settled on the coast of Malabar, and dispersed themselves in various parts of the country. In all probability this number has been greatly exaggerated; and one thousand would be nearer the mark. A full account of the Syrians and Jews will be found in the "Christian Researches" of Claudius Buchanan, who made many successful discoveries in Cochin, of Syriac and Hebrew M. S. S. of the Pentateuch and other parts of the Scriptures, now preserved in the University Library at Cambridge. See also, Wilson's Lands of the Bible.—H. D.
[^*]: In Johnson’s “Relations of the Famous Kingdoms in the World” (4to, 1611), the author thus records of the Nairs. “They inhabit no towns, but dwell in houses made of earth environed with hedges and woods, and their ways as intricate as into a labyrinth. It is strange to see how ready the soldier of this country is at his weapons: they are all gentlemen and termed Nairs. At seven years of age they are put to school to learn the use of their weapons, where, to make them nimble and active, their sinews and joints are stretched by skilful fellows, and anointed with the oil Sesamus: by this anointing they become so light and nimble that they will wind and turn their bodies as if they had no bones, casting them forward, backward, high and low even to the astonishment of the beholders. Their continual delight is in their weapons, persuading themselves that no nation goeth beyond them in skill and dexterity.”

[^*]: The Black pepper vine (*Piper nigrum*) is indigenous to the forests of Malabar and Travancore, and for centuries has been an article of exportation to European countries from that coast. Although growing in other countries of the East, Malabar pepper is considered to be the best. Its cultivation is very simple, and is effected by cuttings or suckers put down before the commencement of the rains in June. The soil should be rich, but if too much moisture be allowed to accumulate near the roots, the young plants are apt to rot. In three years the vine begins to bear. They are planted chiefly in hilly districts, but thrive well enough in the low country in the moist climate of Malabar. They are usually planted at the base of trees which have rough or prickly bark, such as the Jack, the Erythrina, Cashew nut, Mango tree, and others of similar description. They will climb about 20 or 30 feet, but are purposely kept lower than that During their growth it is requisite to remove all suckers, and the vine should be pruned, thinned and kept clear of weeds. After the berries have been gathered they are dried on mats in the sun, turning from red to black. They must be plucked before quite ripe, and if too early they will spoil. White pepper is the same fruit freed from its
[^*]: The cardamoms of commerce (Elettaria cardamomum) are either cultivated or gathered wild. In the Travancore forests they are found at elevations of three or five thousand feet. The mode of obtaining them is to clear the forests of trees, when the plants spontaneously grow up in the cleared ground. A similar mode has been mentioned by Roxburgh, who states that in Wynaad before the commencement of the rains in June, the cultivators seek the shadiest and woodiest sides of the loftier hills, the trees are felled and the ground cleared of weeds, and in about three months the cardamom plant springs up. In four years the shrub will have attained its full height, when the fruit is produced and gathered in the month of November, requiring no other preparation than drying in the sun.
The plant continues to yield fruit till the seventh year when the stem is cut down, new plants arising from the stumps. They may also be raised from seeds. Cardamoms are much esteemed as a condiment, and great quantities are annually shipped to Europe from Malabar and Travancore. In commerce there are three varieties known as the *short*, *short-longs*, and the *long-longs*. Of these the *short* are more coarsely ribbed, of a brown colour and are called the Malabar cardamoms or Wynaad cardamoms. They are reckoned the best of the three. The *long-longs* are more finely ribbed and of a paler colour. The seeds are white and shrivelled. The *short-longs*, merely differ from the latter in being shorter or less pointed. It is usual to mix the several kinds together when ready for exportation. Some care is required in the process of
[^*]: *Areca catechu.* (Linn). Its native place is unknown, but it is extensively distributed in India. It yields the betel nuts of commerce. They are much relished by the Natives, being chewed with the leaf of the betel pepper, (Chavica betel) spread with chunam. A tree will produce annually on an average three hundred nuts. They are one of the staple products of Travancore. The nuts are gathered in July and August, though not fully ripe till October. In the latter country, the nuts are variously prepared for use. Those that are used by families of rank, are collected while the fruit is tender; the husks on the outer pod is removed; the kernel, a round fleshy mass, is boiled in water; in the first boiling of the nut, when properly done, the water becomes red,—thick and starch like, and this afterwards evaporated into a substance like catechu; the boiled nuts being now removed, sliced and dried, the catechu like substance is rubbed to the same, and dried again in the sun, when they become a shining black, ready for use. Whole nuts without being sliced are also prepared in the same form for use amongst the higher classes, while ripe nuts, as well as young nuts in a raw state are used by all classes of people generally, and ripe nuts preserved in water with the pod are also used. When exported to other districts, the nuts are sliced and coloured with red catechu, as also the nut while in the pod. The average amount of exports of the prepared nuts from Travancore, is from 2 to 3,000 kandies annually, exclusive of the nuts in their ordinary state, great quantities of which are shipped to Bombay and other ports. According to the last survey, there were upwards of a million areca palms in Travancore. H. D.
* It appears certain that the brahmins were the original possessors of the country, and that their sway ended about 68 B. C. Subsequently the monarchy became elective and continued so for about 400 years, the term of 12 years being allotted for the reign of each prince. On the death of Cheruma Perumal, the last of these elective kings, the country was divided among his sons; and from them the reigning rajahs claim their descent.
[^*]: About fifty years previous to this, Travancore was split up into numerous petty principalities, whose chieftains were constantly living in a state of warfare among themselves. The chief of them were Nangenaud, Tiroovencode, Ellavelloornaad, Kayencolum, Vemboonaud, Paravoor, Eddapully; and these again were divided by smaller states ad infinitum.
* M. Eustathius de Lannoy was a military adventurer in the rajah of Travancore's service. He constructed the fort of Oodeagherry, where his tomb may still be seen in the ruined chapel inside the fort, now over-grown with jungle. It bears this inscription :—
"Hic jacet Eustathius Benedictus de Lannoy qui tanquam dux generalis militiæ Travancotidis præfuit ac per annos XXXVII fermé summâ felicitate regi inserviit, cui omnia regna ex Caiamcolum usque ad Cochin vi armorum ac terrore subjecit. Vixit annos LXII menses V et mortuus est die 1 Junii MDCCLXXVII.
