**Revenues of the Rajahs of Cochin.—Their mode of Government.—Accounts of the National Assemblies collected in cases of emergency.**

THE Malabar States, in common with all others in the world, possess certain fixed revenues and funds for replenishing the treasury, and maintaining royal pomp, and the welfare of the state ; though here the Rajah's incomes are not very large or out of the common. Their chief profits are derived from their private estates, and the inferior princes are often richer than the reigning sovereign, being possessed of larger free and hereditary properties.

Merchandize is a source of great gain to monarchs whose territories are on the coast, for which reason these Malabar Rajahs have taken so eagerly to commerce. Why, when the Portuguese first visited these coasts, did the Moors possess so much influence over the Zamorin ? Because they, at that time the only maritime traders, procured him so much profit that he feared to disturb them by the reception of strangers.

Ten per cent. is the duty levied on all goods imported into the kingdom of Cochin by private and native merchants, and the profits derived from it are divided between the Company and the Rajah. The latter obtained this privilege originally from the Portuguese, and since their expulsion the East India Company have confirmed him in the enjoyment of it, introducing however some changes in the rate of the duties—the Portuguese having imposed different amounts of duty on different nations, as appears from the following list, on the imports—

| Entity | | Rate and Destination |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| the Moors paid | { | 7 per cent. to the Rajah.* |
| | { | 3 per cent. to Portugal. |
| the Benjanese ,, | { | 5 per cent. to the Rajah. |
| | { | 3 per cent. to Portugal. |
| the Canarese ,, | { | 5 per cent. to the Rajah. |
| | { | 3 per cent. to Portugal. |

But, now, these restrictions are done away with, all paying 10 per cent., of which 6 goes to the Rajah and 4 to the Company. The duty on exports is 6 per cent.

All goods imported by the Company, and those forwarded by them to their settlements and factories elsewhere, are free. There is no rate of tolls fixed for the merchandize of foreign nations, such as French, English, as they are not allowed to trade at the Company's factories. To the Portuguese alone has been conceded by long custom, permission to dispose of sweetmeats, eatables, &c., brought from China, when they put in here on the passage to Goa, paying on these a duty of 4 per cent. to the Company and 6 per cent. to the Rajah. The Company and the Rajah each appoint an officer to collect these dues.

The duty on native commodities, such as pepper, which amounts here to half a ducat per kandy, is paid by the merchant who sells them, and not by the Company. The dues are heavier in the south.

There are certain estates in Malabar, whose owners are obliged to pay an annual tribute in recognition of their proprietorship to the Rajah ; this is regarded rather as a free-will offering than a tax.

All merchandizes conveyed by inland navigation pay a *junkara* or toll of 1 per cent. to the Rajah, the merchants entering the gross amount of their cargo at the *junkenaars* or custom houses, (which are curious edifices, built on piles in the water) ; small as this tax is, it presses heavily enough on the inhabitants, as there are a great many of these custom houses. All vessels bearing the Company's flag, are free and exempt from examination. The duties on tobacco from Coedenatti, Coechim, and Oediampoor are a source of considerable emolument to the Rajah. The native tobacco is somewhat raw in taste ; no doubt it would be much nicer if they understood the art of preparing it as they do in Europe ; for here the leaves are tied up in bundles and sent off before they are properly dried. In Kully Quilon, Poread, and Quilon, tobacco from Java is principally used which is brought by the natives in their annual visits to these shores. The Patterys who are employed in the inland conveyance of goods, pay a fanam in every kingdom through which they travel, for the packs which they carry on their backs ; but there is no charge on those which are carried on the head ; so we always see them loaded with two packs, one carried on the shoulder and the other on the head.

All gardens situated in Carraparam pay a tenth on their fruits to the Rajah of Cochin, who is the sole lord (*volkomen meester*) of the land. He receives a smaller proportion in other places.

On all debts discharged under sentence from the Rajah he receives 20 per cent. Mothers present an offering on the birth of their children. He is the inheritor of the property of all, whether Heathens, Moors, or Jews, who die without heirs, and this sometimes when there are blood relations living. He receives an acknowledgment in money for every office or dignity he confers. If he despatches any of his guards to the assistance of any one he expects a valuable present in return. The visits paid him by his subjects always bring in something, and this is especially the case on their first introductions to him, or if they have any favours to demand. The offerings which they bring, consisting of stuffs, money, fruit, or any thing else, they must deposit at his feet; and this custom is so universal in Malabar that if the natives have any favour to ask of the Commandant, they always bring him presents of pigs, fruit, or poultry.

We must also take into consideration the fines paid by criminals : for the right of passing sentence being vested in the Rajah of each State, they understand how to make the most of the opportunity of making the criminals bleed well in their purses, and there is hardly any crime which may not be expiated by money.

All ruminating animals, such as oxen, cows, buffaloes, belong to the Rajah, as well as those that have five or six teats.

All people, whether of high or low caste, who have transgressed against the distinctions of caste, belong to the Rajah, who generally sells them. No one may wear whiskers, except by his permission, for which a fine or acknowledgment must be paid, and then a great banquet is celebrated in honour of these whiskers.

All leases, renewals of contract, &c., bring him in a small sum, and all deeds of gift and sale must be renewed at the accession of every new monarch. On the death of a feoffee (*Leenman*) his heir must renew the deed of gift, purchase or fief (*gift koop-en-leen*) and pay for it.

A gift for maintenance (*gift tot onderhoud*) conferred by the Rajah on any one who subsequently dies without legitimate heirs, reverts to the Rajah.

All the chiefs of the Mocquas, Chegos, Cannekaas, &c., must pay an annual sum to the Rajah for their dignity.

All Christians, Jews and Moors, wishing to obtain license
to use drums and wind instruments at their festivities and
merry makings must present an offering when they demand
the Rajah's permission. Persons of low caste must do the
same in order to obtain permission to wear the roemol or
fillet round the head, gold rings, &c.

It would seem that the income derived from all these
sources ought to be sufficient to maintain the regal state
handsomely, but as their dominions are for the most part
very limited, the petty Rajahs are generally poor. The
greater Rajahs may amass a considerable fortune, the more
as their expenditure is small.

I shall now add a few words on the mode in which the
Government is conducted. The Rajah is supreme in those
dominions which are immediately subject to him, but not in
the free inheritances which belong to the minor Rajahs and
Caimuls, for every one is sole lord in his own territories.
They know little of assemblies, councils or parliaments. The
Rajah chooses his favourites at his pleasure, consulting them
in particular cases, but generally being guided solely by his
own will, unless that will should run entirely counter to the
customs of the country. Many keep near them a Brahmin
to instruct them in the fundamental and long established
laws and customs.

The only checks upon their arbitrary power are the general assemblies of the nation, which are however, but seldom
held. These are of two kinds : one assembled under orders
of the Rajah, the other by the spontaneous will of the people. Many years elapse between the recurrence of these assemblies. Those summoned by the Rajah are conducted as
follows : He despatches messengers, who by birth and descent are entitled to this office, in all directions to summon
the people. When collected, they sit down in a circle in the
open air, a number of Nairs keeping guard around them.
The propositions are then discussed and measures rejected
or adopted by unanimous silence or clamour. But, in affairs
of minor importance not affecting the welfare of the whole
community, the chiefs of the nation alone are summoned,
and decide upon the question.

The assemblies collected by the will of the nation are conducted in much the same manner, but with more impetuosity. These are never held except in cases of emergency when
the Rajah is guilty of extreme tyranny or gross violation of
the law. Then, all the land proprietors (landsheeren) are bidden to attend, and any one who dared refuse to obey the summons would be subjected by the assembly to the devastation of his gardens, houses, estates, tanks, &c., and, if he were to persist in his obstinacy would be liable to be deprived of his privileges and votes, or even to be sentenced to banishment. As the object of these assemblies is to thwart the will of the Rajah, we are not surprised to find that he does all in his power to obstruct their deliberations. He has no right to attempt to put them down by force of arms, and, besides, so many thousands flock to these meetings that he would find difficulty in so doing if he tried: so he sends a troop of lads called *Pandera Putte* with instructions to provoke them with all manner of annoyances, and to pelt them with stones, sand and dirt. The Nairs on guard do all they can to keep off the assailants with their shields.

If any one, provoked past endurance, were to strike and hurt one of these youths, it would by their laws be regarded as a crime of treason (*geschondene majesteit*) the assembly would be involved in a heavy fine, and be deprived of its inviolability; and the Rajah might then proceed against them by arms; if he were to fail in subduing them they would all desert their allegiance. Allies and neighbours do their best to remedy all the mischief thence ensuing, and endeavour so to intercede between the parties that every one is confirmed in his rights.

The guards (Schuttsmannen) are a body of men employed by the Rajah in the defence of any pagoda or estate to the possession of which their right is disputed. These guards are bound to defend such places at risk of their lives, and to attack the assailants, for whose death they are not held responsible. They do not fear death in the cause, knowing that the Rajah whom they serve is pledged by the laws to revenge their blood. So powerful is the love of revenge in these nations, that in hopes of obtaining it they are willing to encounter death itself, and no reconciliation can ever be brought about until full satisfaction has been taken for the offence.

Thus are public affairs conducted in Malabar, in a very different way from our proceedings in Europe, where each separate nation has its own laws. Meanwhile, I pray the Almighty that he will endow you, who have a share in the management of the Netherland's Exchequer, with wisdom and trust-worthiness in your difficult employment; and subscribe myself.
