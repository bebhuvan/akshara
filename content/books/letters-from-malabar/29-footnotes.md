[^*]: Mala, signifies a mountain, and alam, a district or country.—H. D.
B
[^*]: Another account of this tradition is as follows :—When Parashuramen was performing penance on the mountain Mahandra, where, after having gained twenty-one victories over the Kchettries, he had laid up all his arms, the chief munees or saints came to see him, and, having saluted him, advised him to cause the sea to recede, and to bring to light the land of Kerala, which had been submerged under the ocean in a former age. Parashuramen immediately went to the neighbourhood of Gokarnam and hurling an axe, recovered the land from the sea as far as to where the weapon fell. The limits are Cape Comorin on one side, and Gokarnam on the other. There are three divisions, that of Kerala, Tulu, and Heiga. From Cape Comorin to the river Kanyirota is the Kerala division. The middle portion from thence is the Tulu division. The last part is the Heiga division, the boundary of which is the river Bashpasetu. These three divisions embrace what is now called Mayalim. Parashuramen having thus created the land of Kerala, summoned the Brahmins from a foreign country, and made over the country to them, and giving chief authority to them over the employments and occupations of the four castes, namely, the Brahmin, the Kchettry, Veishya and the Sudra, he rested from his work.—H. D.
[^*]: Laterite, below which is found limestone and lignite. The cliffs rise to nearly 250 feet in some places.—H. D.
[^†]: Antonides van der Goes, a Dutch poet who flourished in the seventeenth century. His principal work was a poem on the river Y, or the “Ystroom.” See Foreign Quarterly Review, Vol. iv. p. 57.
[^*]: The author alludes to the goitre or bronchocele. The classical reader will recollect the line in Juvenal (Sat. xiii. 162.) Quis tumidum guttur miratur in Alpibus? The sufferers were called 'Gutturosi.' It was formerly supposed that this glandular swelling only appeared in certain countries, such as Switzerland and Savoy, and that its origin arose from drinking snow water. It is however found in certain districts of South America, Sumatra, and even in Great Britain, especially in Derbyshire, from whence it has been called the "Derbyshire-Neck." Its origin is very obscure, but as it prevails in countries, both where snow exists and where it does not, drinking snow-water can no longer be asserted as the cause of its appearance.—H. D.
[^†]: Elephantiasis or Cochin Leg. This prevails to a great extent among the inhabitants of the Western Coast ; nor has any certain remedy hitherto been discovered for the diseased part, short of amputation. It is more than probable that bad water and bad diet, are the remote causes of it.—H. D.
[^*]: Hailstorms have occasionally occurred in these districts, though they are of very rare occurrence. One of unusual severity occurred only last month (April 1862) in the town of Cochin itself.—H. D.
[^†]: A knowledge of the monsoons may be traced from very early ages. Humboldt says that Alexander's companions were not ignorant of the existence of the monsoons, by which navigation was so greatly favoured between the Eastern Coasts of Africa and the North and Western parts of India. After having spent ten months in navigating the Indus between Nicæa on the Hydaspes and Pattala, with a view of opening the river to a universal traffic, Nearchus hastened to sail from Stura, at the mouth of the Indus at the beginning of October; since he knew that his passage would be favoured by the N. E. and Eastern Monsoons in the same parallel of latitude. The knowledge of this remarkable local direction of the winds, subsequently emboldened navigators to attempt to sail from Ocelis on the Straits of Babelmandeb, cross the open sea to Muziris (south of Mangalore) the great Malabar emporium of trade, to which products from the Eastern shores of the Indian peninsula, and even gold from the distant Chryse (Borneo?) were brought by inland trade.—(Cosmos.)
[^*]: In John Nieuhoff's "Remarkable Voyages and Travels into the best provinces of the West and East Indies," we find the following description of Cochin, under the date 1662.—"Some authors make mention of two different Cochins, viz.: the old Cochin, lying about a league and a half from the sea-shore. The Portuguese call it *Cochin Daçima*, or Higher Cochin, because it lies higher up the river; by the Dutch it is called *Cochin Malabar*, where the king keeps his residence, being situated upon the banks of a river, and pretty well peopled and adorned with several goodly structures and pagodas. The other, called New Cochin, is scarcely a league from the sea, and was in the possession of the Portuguese."—(TRANS.)
[^†]: Cochin is a sea-coast town, the capital of the principality of that name. In the Malayala language it is called Cocci: deriving its name from a small river which formerly emptied itself there into the sea. In the year 1341, the sea
[^*]: Mud Bay or Muddy Bay, is the commercial port of Alleppie in the kingdom of Travancore, 36 miles south of Cochin, remarkable for the singular natural break-water formed in the open sea, consisting of a long and wide bank of mud, the effect of which is so completely to break the waves, that ships of all sizes can securely anchor even at the stormiest season of the year in the open roads, where the water is perfectly calm. The origin of this deposition of mud, has never been satisfactorily accounted for. It imparts a dirty colour to the water and makes it thick and slimy. It has shifted more or less within the last century, but not to any great extent. A similar deposit exists at Narrakul about 20 miles north of Cochin, and the advantage of this latter place, as a natural open harbour for shipping, has recently been brought to the notice of the British Government.—H. D.
[^†]: The well-known city of Calicut, which has experienced such a variegated fate, lies on the sea-coast, in the latitude of 11° 15′ north. It consists partly of houses constructed of teakwood, and partly of huts composed of palm branches interwoven through each other, and covered with palm leaves. Of stone buildings there are very few. The fortress of Calicut is of much greater antiquity than the city to which it has given its name. The natives of Malabar believe that it was built by *Cheramperumàl* from whom all the petty Malabar princes are descended. This city was raised almost to the ground by Tippoo Sultan, who destroyed its flourishing trade; expelled from the country the merchants and factors of the foreign commercial houses; caused all the cocoa-nut and sandal trees to be cut down; and ordered the pepper plants in the whole surrounding district to be torn up by the roots, and even to be hacked to pieces, because these plants, as he said, brought riches to the Europeans and enabled them to carry on war against the Indians.—*Bartolomeo's Voyage to the East Indies*.
[^*]: Collam, Coilon, Coulon or Quilon, signifies, in Malayalim, a tank. It was built, A. D. 825; and was at one time a place of considerable importance. The natives of the country begin their era from its foundation, in the same manner as the natives of Cochin begin theirs from the origin of the island of Vaipeen. In former days there were a great many weaving-looms, and manufactures of cotton and stoneware here. Alexius Menezes, the first Archbishop of Goa, built an excellent fortress here, which afterwards fell into ruins, being neglected by the Dutch.—H. D.
* The following account of this transaction is given by Captain Alexander Hamilton, who travelled among the East Indies between the years 1688 and 1723. "The Dutch were building the fort of Chetwa, and the Zamorin got "some of his men under the disguise of labourers to be employed by them, "and to take an opportunity of surprising the Dutch. The two lieutenants "who had the overseeing of the work were one evening diverting themselves "with a game at tables in a guard room about half a mile from the fort. "They had let some of their soldiers go straggling about, and the disguised "natives took the opportunity to kill the sentinels, signal to the ambuscade, "and take the half built fort. One of the lieutenants in attempting to retake "it was killed; the other, thinking it impracticable to attack greater forces "within than he had without, embarked for Cochin with his men. I was for- "tuned to be at Cochin when he and his men arrived, and by a Court Martial "he was sentenced to be shot, which sentence I saw executed. The Zamorin "caused the English flag to be hoisted, and the fort was destroyed."—TRANS.
† A *pagger* appears to be a small fortified village or hamlet.
[^1]: * "Proceeding along the sea coast," says Bartolomeo, "you then arrive at Cananore, a town with a castle, and subject to the government of Queen Colatiri, by the Europeans called Collastri. This city is of great antiquity, and the kings of Collatiri belong to the first class of the Indian princes * * *"

The capital of the kingdom of Cananore, called also Colanada, lies in the latitude of 11° 50', and is distinguished by the same name. The whole surrounding district, which extends towards the north, as far as Mount Delly, is inhabited by the *Molandis*, who live merely by piracy. These sea-robbers are mentioned by Pliny, Arrian, Ptolemy, and other ancient authors. They unite themselves to other pirates, who reside on the Angedib islands, near Goa, and capture all the small vessels, which sail from Goa to Cochin. The huts in which their wives and children live, stand on the eastern side of Mount Delly. This mountain, which forms a cape or head-land, lies in the latitude of 12° 5'; and here Malabar or Malayala, properly so called, ends."—*Voyage to E. Indies.*
* Anjengo or Angintenga, a corruption of the two Tamil words unjee taynkul or five cocoa trees, was for many years an English factory and a place of some note in former days. It is now desolate and deserted. The ruins of the Portuguese Church and fort, still exist. Orme, the Historian, was born at Anjengo. For further accounts of this interesting spot see Forbes' Oriental Memoirs, and Abbé Raynal's History of the Indies.—H. D.
[^*]: There is a legend that the old city of Goa was overwhelmed by a sudden rush of the sea, and that its houses may still be seen in calm weather below the waters. The following lines in allusion to this tradition may fitly be inserted in this place.
(1) Rome.
(2) Pompeii.
[^3]: Babylon.
* In 1602 the Dutch East India Company was formed by the amalgamation of several different companies into one united body. The members were invested with authority to conclude peace or make war with Oriental potentates, to build forts and garrison them according to discretion. For many years this new Company acquired considerable authority and power in the East. Its commercial relations were very extensive, and for its better protection the Company despatched a fleet of fourteen vessels, as a support to their numerous colonies. It was not long before they came in contact with their jealous rivals the Portuguese, and the hostile fleets of both nations frequently encountered each other in the Indian seas. It was not till after many conflicts that the superiority of the Dutch was maintained. In less than half a century they had taken or destroyed upwards of 300 Portuguese vessels, and thus made themselves masters of the sea. Upon the destruction of the maritime power of the Portuguese, the Dutch found no difficulty in attacking and capturing their settlements on land, and the booty of military stores and ammunition which they seized in their several conquests, turned greatly to their advantage, as the magazines and fortresses contained everything necessary both for themselves and the prosecution of their commercial projects. Such was the origin of the great prosperity of the Dutch East India Company. Last, after the lapse of a hundred and fifty years, the Company began to decline owing to many concurring circumstances, chiefly from the speculation and avarice of the Government and merchants, and partially from the innumerable wars in which they became engaged. Settlement after settlement becoming a prey to internal faction, or the attack of the natives, fell from their grasp, and the English soon supplanted a power which was unable to maintain itself either by land or sea.—H. D.
[^*]: Kaabeljancos and Flocks, two parties which in the 14th and 15th centuries divided and agitated the whole population of Holland and Zealand. The origin of this burlesque denomination was a dispute between two parties at a feast, as to whether the codfish took the hook, or the hook the codfish? This was made the pretext for a serious quarrel, and the partisans of the towns and of the nobles ranged themselves on either side, the former, the flocks, wore red caps and the latter, the Kaabeljancos, grey ones. Jacqueline of Holland was supported by the former in her quarrel with Philip of Burgundy, and in the year 1492 the extinction of that faction struck a final blow to the dissension. See History of Netherlands by T. Colley Grattan.—(TRANS.)
[^*]: The system of polyandry prevails among the Nair race, and it is owing to this custom that in cases of heirdom to the throne, or succession to property, the descent is recognized only in the female line; the nephew, not the son, becomes the heir.—See Buchanan's Journey into Malabar, Vol. 2, p. 411, 513.—H. D.
[^*]: Ahlwhye or Alwaye is fourteen miles from Cochin, and is still a favourite resort among Europeans for bathing during the hot months. The houses are picturesquely situated on the banks of the river.—H. D.
* A Dutch coin, equal to about a penny.
† A Dutch shilling is worth about six stivers.
"They write on the leaves of wild cocoa trees, cut of the breadth of two inches, and two hands long: of these they lay together as many as they think fit, and put a small stick through them on the top, which done they fasten the stick or both ends to the leaves with packthread;—each of these leaves is called *ola*."-From John Menhoff's Remarkable Voyages and Travels into the best provinces of the West and East Indies.
NOTE.—The East Indian community which is here alluded to has undoubtedly undergone a great change since the days of our Author, consisting of numerous families in all parts of the country most of whom are of high respectability and usefulness. The term Topass has fallen into disuse, but it is singular enough that to the present day, the Europeans in India invariably call ‘boy’ whenever they require their servant, East Indian or Native. H. D.
[^*]: According to other accounts Tupasi is derived from the Sanscrit word *Duibhashi*. *Dui* signifies two, and *Bhashi* a man who speaks two languages; an interpreter. This name, indeed, may with propriety be given to the Tupasi; for besides their mother tongue, they speak some one of the European languages, either English, French, Dutch or Portuguese. At Cochin they are called *Gens de Chapeau*, because they wear a Topi or small hat; whereas the other Indians, not descended from Europeans, make use of the *Romali*, that is, a white turband of the finest muslin.—BARTOLOMEO.
[^*]: “It is probable that a great part of the Christians of St. Thomas in India came from Persia or Chaldea. The rites, liturgy, ceremonies and books of these Christians, bear evident marks of a Chaldaic or Persian extraction. Though the Malabar dialect is at present the mother tongue of the Christians of St. Thomas in India, they, however, employ Chaldaic phrases when they speak of sacred and religious objects. It is, therefore, not improbable, that a considerable number of Christians went from Persia and Chaldea to India, and united themselves to the small body of the original Indian Christians, whose ancestors were formerly converted to the Christian faith by the Apostle Thomas at Mailapuri, which they unanimously consider as the place that first gave birth to Christianity in India. This much is certain, that all these Christians in the year 1502, at which period Vasco de Gama came a second time to Malabar, were Nestorians. Some of them denied the divinity of Christ, and could not endure images; but, on the other hand, they showed a greater reverence for the holy cross. They had no other Sacraments than Baptism, the Last Supper, and the Consecration of Priests. They believed that the souls of the just were not admitted into the presence of God before the final judgment, and that till that period they were to remain in Eden. In the year 1599, these Christians, by the exertions of Alexis Menesez, Archbishop of Goa, were united to the Catholic Church. As some customs of the oriental Churches, were, however, introduced among them in the Council at Udiamper, and as they by degrees found the arbitrary conduct of the Portuguese insupportable, they raised a violent outcry against them; and in a tumultuary congress, held on the 22nd of May, 1653, at Alangatta, at length formally separated from the Catholic Church.”—BARTOLOMEO’S East Indies.
[^*]: The tradition of St. Thomas having preached the gospel in India is thus related by Gibbon (C. 47). "According to the legend of antiquity, the gospel was preached in India by St. Thomas. At the end of the ninth century, his shrine, perhaps in the neighbourhood of Madras, was devoutly visited by the ambassadors of Alfred, and their return with a cargo of pearls and spices rewarded the zeal of the English monarch, who entertained the largest projects of trade and discovery. When the Portuguese first opened the navigation to India, the Christians of St. Thomas had been seated for ages on the Coast of Malabar, and the difference of their character and colour attested the mixture of a foreign race. In arms, in arts, and possibly in virtue, they excelled the natives of Hindoostan: the husbandmen cultivated the palm-tree, the merchants were enriched by the pepper trade, the soldiers preceded the Nairs or nobles of Malabar, and their hereditary privileges were respected by the gratitude or the fear of the king of Cochin and the Zamorin himself. They acknowledged a Gentoo sovereign, but they were governed even in temporal concerns, by the Bishop of Angamala. He still asserted his ancient title of metropolitan of India, but his real jurisdiction was exercised in fourteen hundred Churches, and he was entrusted with the care of two hundred thousand souls. Their religion would have rendered them the firmest and most cordial allies of the Portuguese, but the inquisitors soon discerned in the Christians of St. Thomas the unpardonable guilt of heresy and schism. Instead of owning themselves the subjects of the Roman pontiff, the spiritual and temporal monarch of the globe, they adhered, like their ancestors, to the communion of the Nestorian patriarch; and the Bishops whom he ordained at Mosul, traversed the dangers of the sea and land to reach their diocese on the coast of Malabar. In their Syriac liturgy, the names of Theodore and Nestorius were piously commemorated; they united their adoration of the two persons of Christ; the title of Mother of God was offensive to their ear, and they measured with scrupulous avarice the honours of the Virgin Mary, whom the superstition of the Latins had *almost* exalted to the rank of a goddess. When her image was first presented to the disciples of St. Thomas, they indignantly exclaimed, "We are Christians, not idolators!" and their simple devotion was content with the veneration of the cross. Their separation from the western world, had left them in ignorance of the improvements, or corruptions, of a thousand years; and their conformity with the faith and practice of the fifth century, would equally disappoint the prejudices of a papist or a protestant. It was the first care of the ministers of Rome to intercept all correspondence with the
* The Colony of white Jews residing apart in the midst of the native population is a very remarkable fact. Their number at present is about 300. They are very poor. According to their own statement, their ancestors were refugees from Palestine A. D. 68; when 10,000 Jewish families came and settled on the coast of Malabar, and dispersed themselves in various parts of the country. In all probability this number has been greatly exaggerated; and one thousand would be nearer the mark. A full account of the Syrians and Jews will be found in the "Christian Researches" of Claudius Buchanan, who made many successful discoveries in Cochin, of Syriac and Hebrew M. S. S. of the Pentateuch and other parts of the Scriptures, now preserved in the University Library at Cambridge. See also, Wilson's Lands of the Bible.—H. D.
[^*]: In Johnson’s “Relations of the Famous Kingdoms in the World” (4to, 1611), the author thus records of the Nairs. “They inhabit no towns, but dwell in houses made of earth environed with hedges and woods, and their ways as intricate as into a labyrinth. It is strange to see how ready the soldier of this country is at his weapons: they are all gentlemen and termed Nairs. At seven years of age they are put to school to learn the use of their weapons, where, to make them nimble and active, their sinews and joints are stretched by skilful fellows, and anointed with the oil Sesamus: by this anointing they become so light and nimble that they will wind and turn their bodies as if they had no bones, casting them forward, backward, high and low even to the astonishment of the beholders. Their continual delight is in their weapons, persuading themselves that no nation goeth beyond them in skill and dexterity.”
[^*]: The *pisang* is the *Areca catechu*, or Betel-nut palm (Trans.), See Brandes' Dict. of Science, &c.
[^*]: The Black pepper vine (*Piper nigrum*) is indigenous to the forests of Malabar and Travancore, and for centuries has been an article of exportation to European countries from that coast. Although growing in other countries of the East, Malabar pepper is considered to be the best. Its cultivation is very simple, and is effected by cuttings or suckers put down before the commencement of the rains in June. The soil should be rich, but if too much moisture be allowed to accumulate near the roots, the young plants are apt to rot. In three years the vine begins to bear. They are planted chiefly in hilly districts, but thrive well enough in the low country in the moist climate of Malabar. They are usually planted at the base of trees which have rough or prickly bark, such as the Jack, the Erythrina, Cashew nut, Mango tree, and others of similar description. They will climb about 20 or 30 feet, but are purposely kept lower than that During their growth it is requisite to remove all suckers, and the vine should be pruned, thinned and kept clear of weeds. After the berries have been gathered they are dried on mats in the sun, turning from red to black. They must be plucked before quite ripe, and if too early they will spoil. White pepper is the same fruit freed from its
[^*]: The cardamoms of commerce (Elettaria cardamomum) are either cultivated or gathered wild. In the Travancore forests they are found at elevations of three or five thousand feet. The mode of obtaining them is to clear the forests of trees, when the plants spontaneously grow up in the cleared ground. A similar mode has been mentioned by Roxburgh, who states that in Wynaad before the commencement of the rains in June, the cultivators seek the shadiest and woodiest sides of the loftier hills, the trees are felled and the ground cleared of weeds, and in about three months the cardamom plant springs up. In four years the shrub will have attained its full height, when the fruit is produced and gathered in the month of November, requiring no other preparation than drying in the sun.
The plant continues to yield fruit till the seventh year when the stem is cut down, new plants arising from the stumps. They may also be raised from seeds. Cardamoms are much esteemed as a condiment, and great quantities are annually shipped to Europe from Malabar and Travancore. In commerce there are three varieties known as the *short*, *short-longs*, and the *long-longs*. Of these the *short* are more coarsely ribbed, of a brown colour and are called the Malabar cardamoms or Wynaad cardamoms. They are reckoned the best of the three. The *long-longs* are more finely ribbed and of a paler colour. The seeds are white and shrivelled. The *short-longs*, merely differ from the latter in being shorter or less pointed. It is usual to mix the several kinds together when ready for exportation. Some care is required in the process of
[^*]: *Areca catechu.* (Linn). Its native place is unknown, but it is extensively distributed in India. It yields the betel nuts of commerce. They are much relished by the Natives, being chewed with the leaf of the betel pepper, (Chavica betel) spread with chunam. A tree will produce annually on an average three hundred nuts. They are one of the staple products of Travancore. The nuts are gathered in July and August, though not fully ripe till October. In the latter country, the nuts are variously prepared for use. Those that are used by families of rank, are collected while the fruit is tender; the husks on the outer pod is removed; the kernel, a round fleshy mass, is boiled in water; in the first boiling of the nut, when properly done, the water becomes red,—thick and starch like, and this afterwards evaporated into a substance like catechu; the boiled nuts being now removed, sliced and dried, the catechu like substance is rubbed to the same, and dried again in the sun, when they become a shining black, ready for use. Whole nuts without being sliced are also prepared in the same form for use amongst the higher classes, while ripe nuts, as well as young nuts in a raw state are used by all classes of people generally, and ripe nuts preserved in water with the pod are also used. When exported to other districts, the nuts are sliced and coloured with red catechu, as also the nut while in the pod. The average amount of exports of the prepared nuts from Travancore, is from 2 to 3,000 kandies annually, exclusive of the nuts in their ordinary state, great quantities of which are shipped to Bombay and other ports. According to the last survey, there were upwards of a million areca palms in Travancore. H. D.
* It appears certain that the brahmins were the original possessors of the country, and that their sway ended about 68 B. C. Subsequently the monarchy became elective and continued so for about 400 years, the term of 12 years being allotted for the reign of each prince. On the death of Cheruma Perumal, the last of these elective kings, the country was divided among his sons; and from them the reigning rajahs claim their descent.
[^*]: About fifty years previous to this, Travancore was split up into numerous petty principalities, whose chieftains were constantly living in a state of warfare among themselves. The chief of them were Nangenaud, Tiroovencode, Ellavelloornaad, Kayencolum, Vemboonaud, Paravoor, Eddapully; and these again were divided by smaller states ad infinitum.
* M. Eustathius de Lannoy was a military adventurer in the rajah of Travancore's service. He constructed the fort of Oodeagherry, where his tomb may still be seen in the ruined chapel inside the fort, now over-grown with jungle. It bears this inscription :—
"Hic jacet Eustathius Benedictus de Lannoy qui tanquam dux generalis militiæ Travancotidis præfuit ac per annos XXXVII fermé summâ felicitate regi inserviit, cui omnia regna ex Caiamcolum usque ad Cochin vi armorum ac terrore subjecit. Vixit annos LXII menses V et mortuus est die 1 Junii MDCCLXXVII.
