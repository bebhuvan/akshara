## PREFACE BY THE EDITOR

THE original volume, of which the following pages are a translation, came accidentally into my hands while at Cochin about two years ago, and imagining it might possess some interesting matter, I took it to England, and had it faithfully translated under my own superintendence. The present reproduction contains the entire work, with the exception of one or two chapters, relating to Java, and the Dutch dependencies of the Eastern Archipelago. These were purposely omitted, as they had no reference to the affairs of the Malabar Coast.

There can be little doubt that Dutch writings on the subject of the East are very numerous, though but little known to us; chiefly, of course from the fact of their being sealed up in a tongue which few care to acquire in the present day. Yet, if we consider for how considerable a period of time the Dutch were masters of the Malabar Coast and Ceylon and what laborious writers and compilers they were, both at home and abroad when in the zenith of their power and prosperity, there must surely be many works which, if rendered available for the English reader, would throw much interesting light upon the administration of their Eastern possessions.

The early Dutch voyagers, such as Linschoten, Valentyn, Nieuhoff and others had their works published separately or collectively, and are numerous enough, but a few only have been translated into the English language.

When Dr. Claudius Buchanan visited Cochin in 1806 (see his Christian Researches), it is believed there were large collections of Dutch and Portuguese books to be found in Cochin, but which were subsequently destroyed wholesale. The present volume is probably one of the few which escaped the vandalism of those days, while many others may yet be lying in dishonoured obscurity. In addition to these "Letters from Malabar," I procured a MS. account of Cochin and Malabar, which was written by M. Adrian van Moens, who was the Dutch Governor of Cochin about 1772, and who appears to have been a man of considerable energy and ability. He greatly improved the fortifications of the place, and otherwise rendered great services to the town and its neighbourhood. This MS. is a large 4to. volume and is now among the Government Records in Cochin.

Of the Author of the "Letters from Malabar," I can find no account beyond what is in the preface of the Dutch edition. The name of Canterfisher is not unknown on the Coromandel Coast, and persons of that name, whom the present generation may recollect at Madras, were probably descendants of the Dutch author.

## EXTRACT FROM THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE

I have been induced to write these Memoirs by the desire to relate the veracious circumstances of which I have either myself been an eyewitness, or which I have heard from trustworthy persons; for, all I shall say respecting the manners and customs of the Malabars I have drawn from the fountain head, namely, from the natives themselves, and particularly from such among them as are most thoroughly acquainted with them—their brahmins and lawyers. The task has cost me much labour and trouble, and a good deal of patience too; for these people are very slow, and can only be forced to answer our enquiries by continual prompting.

The reader need not expect any description of the incidents which have happened to me, or a narrative of my voyages, misfortunes, the storms and such things, with which almost all books of travels are filled. My observations will bear only upon the manners and customs of the people, their laws, rites and ceremonies, the description of their kingdoms, as well as their origin and their modes of government, and other similar subjects.

## EXTRACT FROM THE DUTCH EDITOR'S DEDICATION

The following pages contain observations upon that part of India which is called the Coast of Malabar, describing the nature of the country, the varieties of its inhabitants, and the manner of life in vogue there, both among the Dutch themselves and the heathens and mahometans.

My brother Jacobus Canter Visscher, at the time he wrote these letters to his friends at home, was Chaplain at Cochin, the chief town of that country; he lived there five whole years, during which time he had sufficient opportunity to examine into matters there. He was afterwards a Minister of God's Word at Batavia, in the Portuguese language. It would not become me in this place to expatiate upon his abilities, but your Excellencies will allow me to say simply, as a proof that he has been as accurate as it was possible for him to be, that from his youth upward he took delight in reading accounts of travels, and was filled by them with a strong desire himself to visit distant lands and nations, and to ascertain the truth or falsehood of other writers. This desire grew so irresistible, that, as soon as he had completed his studies, although he was by no means without hope of promotion in his native country, he accepted an appointment from the East India Company and gladly undertook the voyage to the East; the Divine Providence placed him at first in the not uncelebrated region of which he here gives the description.

These letters were not written merely for the edification of his friends and acquaintance, but with the view of publication at a suitable time; he kept a copy of them himself, and had arranged them in what appeared to him a natural order.

This copy having, since my brother's death, fallen into my hands, I have resolved to publish it; and have taken the liberty to dedicate it to your Excellencies, humbly begging you to receive it favourably.

I remain, as I have always been,
Right Hon'ble Lords and Ladies,
Your humble and obedient servant,
C. T. VISSCHER,
*Chaplain at Pingjum.*

16th August, 1743.
