A comprehensive study of the Rig-Veda and Vedic religion, this work provides an accessible introduction to the sacred literature of the early Aryans in India. Written for the general student rather than the specialist, it traces the development of Vedic thought from the nature worship of the Rig-Veda through the ritualistic formalism of the Brahmanas to the philosophical insights of the Upanishads.

## Contents

The book is organized into seven main sections:

- **The Aryans**: Their origins, migrations, daily life, social structure, and early civilization
- **The Vedas of the Aryans**: The formation, transmission, and structure of Vedic literature
- **The Nature of Vedic Gods**: Characteristics, classification, and theological concepts including henotheism
- **A Classified Account of the Vedic Gods**: Detailed examination of major deities organized by celestial domain
- **The Sacrifices of the Aryans**: Ritual practices, ceremonial procedures, and their significance
- **The Prayers of the Aryans**: Analysis of Vedic hymns and their spiritual content
- **The Message of the Rig-Veda**: The enduring legacy and influence of Vedic thought

The work includes extensive readings from the Vedas in English translation, drawing primarily from R. T. H. Griffith's acclaimed translations, along with detailed appendices covering Vedic metres, Sanskrit language, and the contents of all four Vedas.

## Scholarly Approach

Clayton's work represents early 20th-century scholarship on the Vedas, drawing on the research of Max Müller, Macdonell, Bloomfield, and other pioneering Indologists. While written from a Christian missionary perspective, it provides valuable insights into Vedic religion and includes careful translations and extensive footnotes that remain useful for students of ancient Indian thought.
