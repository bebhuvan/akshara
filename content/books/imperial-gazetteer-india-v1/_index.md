The Imperial Gazetteer of India represents one of the most ambitious reference works ever produced about the Indian subcontinent. This first volume of the new 1909 edition provides a systematic and comprehensive description of India's physical, biological, and human geography.

Dedicated to King Edward VII, Emperor of India, this volume was published under the authority of His Majesty's Secretary of State for India in Council. It greatly expands upon the earlier editions edited by Sir William Wilson Hunter, incorporating data from the Census of 1901 and contributions from numerous officials and experts across British India.

The ten chapters cover: the extraordinary variety of India's physical aspects from the Himalayas to the Deccan plateau; the geological evolution of the subcontinent; the monsoon system and climate patterns; the diverse flora and fauna; the complex ethnology and caste system; the multitude of languages spoken; the major religions practiced; population statistics and trends; and the critical issues of public health and vital statistics.

This volume provides essential contextual knowledge for understanding the economic, social, and political dimensions of British India discussed in subsequent volumes of the series.
