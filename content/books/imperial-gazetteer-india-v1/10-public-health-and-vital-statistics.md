The general state of the public health in every country depends on the measure of adjustment of the relations of the individual and the race to the environment: the more complete and continuous the adjustment, the greater the longevity. The tendency of European civilization is to give man more and more complete control of his surroundings, whereas in India these are actually and relatively stronger, more capricious and unreliable, than in the West, while the individual is less resistant and adaptable. These influences have moulded the moral and physical character of the people and their civilization; and a brief reference to some of the salient features of the situation will tend to elucidate the vital statistics, as well as to explain some of the peculiar difficulties of the problems they disclose.

As regards the individual, the main general results of the marriage customs are those to be expected from the absence of free selection and from endogamous restriction: viz. increase in the power of transmitting characteristics ('prepotency'), a deterioration of physique [^1], lessened resistance to disease, and, possibly, some relative impairment of fertility. The almost universal custom of marriage at puberty implies that practically all the immature adolescents of every generation have an equal opportunity of propagating their kind; and there is none of the salutary elimination effected in the West by the celibacy of large classes. The general average product must be lower; and apart from the greater tendency to disease, inherited and acquired, the duration of life is affected in another way. For there is probably a direct relation between early marriage and the duration of the reproductive functions, and the premature strain on the latter tends to their earlier cessation. The climacteric is advanced, with all the corresponding results of earlier degeneration, and we thus obtain a more rapid vital cycle involving premature senility. As regards the individual, as will be seen later on, an enormous sacrifice is also incurred in the loss of maternal and infant life. On the other hand, the rapid succession of the generations, probably five or more in a century, is favourable to the process of adjustment to an environment that is subject to constant changes: we may see the results in the rapid recuperation of the people after famine and epidemics, and possibly in the relative immunity they possess to some of the chief causes of mortality.

With respect to nutrition, it cannot be doubted that the quality and nature of the food of the majority leaves much to be desired, and on this the measure of vital resistance largely depends, while the quantity available appears to influence the birth-rate in a marked degree. These combined effects are strongly emphasized in times of scarcity and famine, with consequent radical modification in the number, the vitality, and the age constitution of the population. Under ordinary conditions, the essential protein (nitrogenous) element available is largely diminished by waste in all vegetable food, and primitive methods of cooking and digestive debility add to the loss. These disabilities are greatly enhanced in sickness, when bulky, dry, and ill-cooked food cannot be taken, and this is a factor in the heavy mortality and the economic loss from prostration. Finally, poverty, of which sickness and mortality are perhaps the chief causes, has a direct effect on the resources in food, clothing, and housing, and on the standard of comfort, and so of 'resistance,' while it affects detrimentally the power to achieve measures of amelioration.

Coming now to the general environment, its special characteristics may be briefly indicated under three heads: religious and moral, social, and physical. The whole tone of religious thought, with its philosophy of fatalism, is against the individualistic self-assertion necessary to success in the struggle for existence; it is opposed to co-operation for civic ideals; and it promotes indifference to life. Evidence of this is seen in the now suppressed practices of the sacrifice of widows (sati) and female infanticide, and in the treatment of women in child-bed. Disastrous effects on a larger scale frequently follow on the congregation of vast numbers at places of pilgrimage, where the rites involve overcrowding, exposure, and the consumption of unwholesome, if sacred, food and water. The duties of daily life, limited in their application to the individual and the family, are ordered and performed as religious rites which the British Government is pledged to respect as long as they do not outrage the moral law; and herein lies one difficulty in securing the observance of the sanitary ordinances which have occupied so large a place in the Statute Book of recent years. The caste constitution of society, if justified in the circumstances of its origin and in many of its results, imposes a rigid bar to free competition and to the development of civilization. Again, many of the conditions of social life are largely the result of the anarchy and insecurity of life and property that prevailed anterior to British rule. This, with the climate and the water-supply, has determined the insanitary structure of the dwellings and their arrangement in aggregates, while the seclusion of women of the better classes has also had evil effects on the race of the natural leaders of the people. There has been little, if any, adjustment to the new conditions which are the outcome of the pax Britannica, while the most important of these conditions, operating on the cumulative effects of religion and custom, has resulted in an enormous increase of population. This has led to extraordinary density over great areas, and to overcrowding, to which the development of industrial enterprise has greatly contributed in many large centres, while it must be remembered that an overwhelming proportion of the sickness and mortality is caused by specific communicable diseases.

Of the predominant features of the physical environment much might be said, but the following remarks must be confined to brief suggestions of the influence of rainfall and range of temperature. Nine-tenths of the vast population live from the land; and the two indispensable conditions of existence, the supply of food and water, depend almost entirely, in the greater part of India, upon the character of the summer monsoon, i.e. upon the rainfall that occurs during some three or four months, which is then stored in, and on, the soil for consumption during the rest of the year. Speaking generally, the country is subject annually to a short period of deluge and a longer one of dryness, but there are the greatest contrasts in the relative intensity of the phenomena in different areas under normal conditions. These, moreover, give place, from time to time, to periods of excess or failure of the rains, with consequent accentuation of the phenomena in proportion to their duration and the area affected. Now, the sources of water-supply are of three kinds, surface 'tanks' (ponds), shallow wells, and rivers [^1], while everywhere, save in a few of the largest towns, all sewage and liquid and solid waste are committed to the soil for disposal, either by deposit on the surface or by burial, and this generally in close proximity to the inhabited site. The effect of heavy and continuous rain, which is far less penetrating in proportion to its quantity than outside the tropics, is to wash the accumulated soil impurities into the water-sources and to leave stagnant collections of water where drainage is defective. The ground-water, replenished by percolation often too rapid for effective filtration, rises quickly in the wells, until in a few weeks, over large areas, it is within a few feet of the surface which it frequently reaches by the end of the monsoon. In this way the majority of the wells of the inhabited sites are rendered saline and non-potable by infiltration of sewage salts. Meanwhile, all the conditions of life have been transformed: water is abundant, but certainly at first impure; coarse green vegetables largely replace the simple grain diet; there are frequent sudden alterations in temperature, against which the clothing resources are inadequate, and the people are driven to the shelter of their dwellings; the cultivation of rice, the staple food-crop of large areas, necessitates interference with the natural drainage; and lastly, there is a great development of insect and micro-organic life. Here we have all the conditions that lead to bowel complaints and fevers; and the mortality curve, which is generally lowest in June, rises, with the monsoon period, to its highest point in the two succeeding months. Thereafter, through the next six months, the course of events is reversed: the water-supplies and surface collections are gradually depleted; and as the hot season advances many are completely exhausted, most of those that persist being reduced to the condition of muddy puddles in the case of wells and tanks, and to a stagnant chain of pools in the case of all but the largest rivers. If the monsoon should fail, or cease early, the conditions are aggravated: the supply of the prime necessity of existence is cut off at innumerable sources, causing an overwhelming call on those that remain, which are subject to greatly enhanced risks of pollution. It is too frequently the custom to use the same supply, indiscriminately, for the various purposes of drinking, bathing, washing clothes, and watering cattle; and it will be understood that in these circumstances an outbreak of cholera is frequently added to failure of the food supply. It will be seen later how, by its influence on the mortality and the food-supply, the rainfall also largely affects the birth-rate.

As regards the range of temperature, which varies greatly in different areas at different seasons, but which is generally far greater than in Europe, it is easy to trace its influence on the important vital condition of the supply of pure air in dwellings. It largely determines the materials and structure of these; hence the striking contrast between the reed and thatch hut of the typical Bengal hamlet and the impervious mud and brick structures of the dry inland tracts where the range is highest and where protection from extremes of heat and cold is necessitated. Here, also, dwellings were aggregated under the necessity for defence, and consequently present all the features of camps; there were no arrangements for site-ventilation, or conservancy; and even now the cattle are driven at night into close courtyards, and often into dwellings, which are devoid of appliances for the admission of light and air. The joint-family system involves overcrowding, especially in sleeping rooms, which is most marked in towns; and where the range of temperature is greatest, the effects of the scanty resources in clothing are also most manifest. There is abundant evidence to show that these conditions, varying in degree over large areas, determine the incidence of diseases of the 'zymotic' class, and especially of typhus and the contagious fevers; also of pneumonia, phthisis, and other fatal lung disorders, which are favoured by aggregation in foul air, and which are the causes of a very large proportion of the sickness and mortality.

To sum up, we have a vast and heterogeneous population, in a primitive and rigid stage of civilization which involves certain physical and moral disabilities, dependent in general on the land not only for daily bread, but for all material resources. The marked feature of the general situation is man's comparative subordination to the environment, against which the struggle is maintained, with varying issue, rather than with his fellow men. The character of the rainfall determines the quantity and quality of the food and water-supplies, and through these, in a large measure, the health of the community, as evidenced by the high and fluctuating birth and death-rates and by the frequent reversal of their normal relations; and this occurs not only in specially unfavourable years, but in certain months of the year under more ordinary circumstances.

In approaching the discussion of the vital statistics of the general population, it is necessary to explain that we are still far from a complete and accurate record of the births and deaths, and of the causes of death; that there is no record of marriages, and but a very inadequate one of sickness. Registration was first instituted in British India generally about thirty years ago, much later in certain areas, and to-day (1905) some of the less accessible hill tracts and most of the Native States are still outside its scope. The difficulties encountered have been great, and many remain. The people, doubtful of the object, shrink from publicity in domestic affairs. The agents are, for the most part, illiterate village watchmen, or town police, who are required to report to the police station at regular but varying intervals the simple fact of birth or death and the supposed cause in the latter event. As to the record of actual occurrences, the error of defect varies considerably in different areas: in some it is almost negligible, in others it may amount to nearly one-third of the total, but there is a general progressive improvement everywhere. The statement of the cause of death leaves much to be desired: the vast majority die without qualified medical attendance, and we have to rely on the crude impressions of the people, who attribute most fatal illnesses marked by a rise of temperature to 'fever,' and who, during epidemics, frequently conceal either the fact or the true cause, in order to escape sanitary measures. At such times, and also during famine, special sources of fallacy arise from the migration of large numbers, so that, even if the facts are obtained by special effort, the local ratios are vitiated. Everywhere efforts are made to check the records by local inquiries, and, in many towns, by supervision of the appointed places for burial or burning.

A general Census was first taken between 1867 and 1872, and was repeated in 1881, 1891, and 1901. The value of these enumerations has been inestimable, though the return of ages is by no means accurate and there has possibly been some concealment of females. The figures have enabled us to obtain an approximate estimate of the true birth and death-rates, and of the mortality by age and sex, and thus have afforded data for the construction of a Life Table. The great fluctuations in the birth and death-rates, and the frequent reversal of their normal relations, are marked in the irregular progress of the population, and for this reason the census figures soon become inaccurate for ratio calculations in inter-censal periods. With these limitations, it will be seen that the material for a closely reasoned analysis is often lacking. But the recorded facts are of great value in the study of the conditions of each area; of far less use, though still suggestive, for inter-Provincial comparisons. Any attempt to trace the effect of sanitary measures on the health of the people is at present beset by obvious fallacies, for as registration improves the rates tend to rise in any case; but there is abundant evidence forthcoming on this question in the vital statistics of the troops and prisoners which are discussed later on in this chapter.

The following statement gives a general view of the birth-rates recorded in different Provinces during the two decades ending with 1890 and 1900, with other particulars for comparison:—

* The probable true normal rates (column 6) are taken from the Report of Mr. Hardy, F.I.A., F.S.S., Census Report, 1891, vol. ii. The rate for all Provinces (combined) is calculated at 48.8 per mille, and this may be assumed to represent, approximately, the rates for the areas for which separate calculations have not yet been made. The subsequent decade (1891–1900) was marked by abnormal conditions arising from famine and plague.

† Famine in these areas during last quinquennium.

In spite of defective registration, the recorded rates are generally high in comparison with those of Europe, outside Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy: the 'probable true rates' are much higher without exception. There is great variation both in the recorded rates of different areas for the same period, and in those of different years for the same area: this is partly due to the influence of famine, and partly to differences in the registration error, the approximate measure of which is obtained by comparing the 'probable true rates' with those recorded in the non-famine period (1881-90). In Europe the average number of births per 1,000 married women at age 15-50 may be put at 250; and consequently the Indian rates (column 5) indicate defective registration or relative infertility, and doubtless both factors are in operation.

We may now proceed to discuss the chief influences which determine these characteristic results. The marriage customs must undoubtedly be given a foremost place, for marriage is, in effect, not a voluntary contract as in the West, but a religious obligation, binding on both sexes, which is enforced by the social code and necessitated by the law of inheritance. Briefly, it is as a rule contracted, in the higher castes which acknowledge Brahmanical authority, with a girl who has not arrived at puberty (though consummation is generally deferred till then), while the husband is often much older; unions are forbidden between persons of the same kindred and between those of differing castes and sub-castes; more than one wife is permitted, failing male issue by the first; widowers may remarry, but this is not permitted to widows. The results are that marriage is almost universal, at the earliest practicable age; there is disparity in the ages of husband and wife; and, as a consequence, an excessive proportion of widows. These general rules and results are subject to modification in the practice of the lower Hindu castes, Musalmāns, Buddhists, Native Christians, and some aboriginal tribes. Among them, as a rule, the age of the female at marriage is generally higher and the disparity in the ages of husband and wife is less; there is also a freer choice, from the absence of caste restrictions; and there is no restriction on widow remarriage. The following figures will afford a clearer view of the situation by comparison with Europe: it is interesting to note in passing that Hungary occupies a position, in this respect, midway between East and West.

<div style="text-align: center;">Percentage Distribution of the Population by Civil Condition.</div>

| AGE AND CIVIL CONDITION. | INDIA (1901). |  | EUROPE (EXCLUDING HUNGARY). |  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  | Male. | Female. | Male. | Female. |
| All ages |  |  |  |  |
| Unmarried | 49.2 | 34.4 | 63.0 | 59.0 |
| Married | 45.4 | 47.6 | 33.0 | 32.0 |
| Widowed | 5.4 | 17.9 | 3.5 | 8.3 |
| 15—25 |  |  |  |  |
| Unmarried | 51.8 | 11.3 | 95.0 | 85.0 |
| Married | 45.8 | 82.8 | 4.7 | 14.0 |
| Widowed | 2.4 | 5.9 | 0.05 | 0.2 |
| 26—40 |  |  |  |  |
| Unmarried | 12.5 | 2.5 | 36.0 | 28.6 |
| Married | 81.7 | 80.1 | 62.0 | 67.8 |
| Widowed | 5.8 | 17.4 | 1.4 | 3.5 |

Among the many interesting facts to which these figures point, we may merely note the contrasts displayed in the proportions of the population married in India and Europe, and again in the proportions of the widowed and the single among males and females in India at the two age periods, denoting the earlier age at marriage of females and its penalty in widowhood. Here, then, are the conditions for a high birth-rate; but, at the same time, factors that doubtless operate to diminish the full measure of fertility which the mere marriage-rate would lead one to expect among a people the vast majority of whom are impelled by religious and social sanctions to disregard prudential considerations. The early age at marriage, with the premature strain on the immature functions, probably leads to early exhaustion in both sexes, which is perhaps hastened by the debilitating effects of malarial fevers to which all are subject; the practice of the prolonged suckling of infants may also operate. Lastly, the earliest age of procreative power is not the age of greatest fecundity.

But, in dealing next with the causes of the fluctuations in the birth-rate, we find influences at work of far greater and less questionable force: namely, those that affect prosperity, which, in India, is summed up for the masses in sufficient food and a relative diminution of sickness. The marriage rate is affected by the character of the harvests, as the ceremony involves lavish expenditure, loans being generally raised for which the crops are the security. But the birth-rate is a far more sensitive barometer of prosperity, because the marriage of children does not usually connote cohabitation. Nothing is clearer than the effects of marked abundance of food or the reverse upon the general state of the public health, and of both food and health upon the birth-rate. With any marked rise or fall in food prices there is immediately a similar movement in the death-rate, and an opposite movement in the birth-rate nine months later. When famine prevails and, subsequently, other factors co-operate, marriages are deferred and the able-bodied leave their homes in search of work or relief. With the recurrence of the first bountiful harvest the tide turns, deferred marriages are celebrated, cohabitation is resumed, and the sexual instinct, depressed by privation, resumes its sway fortified by rest and by comparatively abundant food. The death-rate now falls rapidly to below the normal, owing to the previous elimination of the physically weakest; and nine months later the birth-rate (calculated on the total population, which now contains a larger proportion of persons at the reproductive ages) rises with a bound and is maintained above the normal, generally for about a year, when the ordinary relations of the rates are resumed.

Similar influences may be traced in the normal seasonal incidence of the birth-rate, which is stamped with the same characteristic features in every Province, though these are subject to slight local modifications referable to the period of the harvest and of the greatest sickness and mortality. Speaking generally, where the staple food harvest is reaped in October there is a sudden rise in the birth-rate in July, continued through August to the maximum in September–October. There is a gradual fall during November–December, though the rate is still above the mean, which is reached in January; thenceforth the decline persists more or less steadily, to attain the lowest point in June. Where the staple food harvest comes in December, events are consistently postponed for about two months. The influence of the general health is manifest if the birth and death-rates are plotted together on a chart with an interval of nine or ten months between them, i.e. the death-rate for January against the birth-rate for October, and so on; the result is a striking contrast in the curves, the one falling as the other rises, though there may be occasional trifling exceptions to the rule. Again, on irrigated tracts with adequate drainage, where the crops are secure, the birth-rate is consistently high: conversely, where in water-logged areas the soil deteriorates and the people are prostrated by chronic malarial disease, there is often depopulation from impairment of fecundity.

Regarding the influence of race, the records only furnish particulars under local territorial distinctions: the main ethnic elements are nearly everywhere largely interfused, and any comparison between areas wherein the dominant element varies is vitiated by the registration error. Religion affords no reliable clue to ethnic distinctions. It is possible, however, to arrive at some estimate of the relative fecundity of the different races and sects by means of the Census returns of the proportion of children in each. As a rule, the aboriginal tribes and the Musalmānis (who are often proselytes from the lower Hindu castes) stand out from the general community in this respect. This is due partly to the more favourable marriage customs previously alluded to, and possibly also to the greater variety of food, which generally contains a larger measure of the animal element than among Hindus.

The proportion borne by males to females at birth is shown below:—

| Province. | Males born to 100 females. (Mean of 1891-1900). |
|---|---|
| Punjab . . . . | 111.6 |
| Sind . . . . | 109.0 |
| Western Bengal . . . . | 108.1 |
| United Provinces . . . . | 107.7 |
| Central Provinces . . . . | 107.4 |
| Berar . . . . | 106.8 |
| Bombay . . . . | 106.5 |
| Assam . . . . | 106.4 |
| Madras . . . . | 104.4 |
| Lower Burma . . . . | 106.4 |

The range within each area is greatest where registration, always at its worst in regard to events affecting females, is most defective. The highest proportion of males is returned in areas where the male population outnumbers the female, and where the practice of female infanticide formerly prevailed; but in certain parts of two of the Provinces at the top of the list registration is notoriously very defective, viz. in the Western Punjab and in Sind. The records of Berar, where registration is at its best, show that the excess of males born in the January to June or July period is always very much higher than during the rest of the year, the mean during a normal quinquennium being, for the first six months of the year, 107.3, and for the last six months 104.8. Now the corresponding periods of conception are April to September and October to March; and the latter period is associated with three distinct factors—the harvest, the season of least sickness and mortality, and that of the lowest temperature, which would appear to influence favourably the relatively higher production of females [^2].

The results of urban and rural conditions on the birth-rate will be gathered from the statement below:—

| PROVINCE. | Ratio per 1,000 of population (Mean of 1892-6). |  |
|---|---|---|
|  | Urban. | Rural. |
| Bengal | 24.9 | 34.3 |
| Assam. | 24.4 | 31.5 |
| United Provinces | 40.2 | 37.4 |
| Punjab | 40.4 | 43.8 |
| Central Provinces | 32.2 | 35.7 |
| Bihar | 38.2 | 37.5 |
| Madras | 32.1 | 27.4 |
| Bombay | 28.5 | 36.4 |
| Burma | 22.3 | 28.6 |

The rates are, as a rule, lower in the towns, and lowest in the large industrial centres, owing, chiefly, to the unequal sex distribution of their population which is affected by the demand for adult male labourers—e.g. in Calcutta (1901) the proportion of males to females was as two to one, in Bombay over three to two, and in Rangoon nearly two and a half to one. The tendency to a general rise in the price of food which has marked recent times, while benefiting the agriculturist, has doubtless pressed heavily on the poorer classes in towns, where also the general standard of vitality is lower. Lastly, the women are frequently sent to their rural homes for their confinement.

The record of still-births has unfortunately not been maintained generally, but for Berar the returns give what is doubtless a fair indication of the proportion which occur in an agricultural community in India. Here, during the decade ending 1900, still-born males were at the rate of 5.2, and females of 4.1, per cent. of the live-births of the respective sexes. In the larger cities, however, the rates are far higher: in Calcutta the average for the three years ending 1900 was 8 per cent. of the live-births; in Rangoon it was 11.6 per cent.; and in Bombay the mean for 1895-9 was 12.9 per cent., rising to 18.7 in the last year. But here the rates have recently been affected by the prevalence of plague and famine, which have driven mothers from and to the city in a destitute condition. The figures represent the pressure of want and insanitary conditions, and, doubtless, of barbarous midwifery; at the same time there is no guarantee that all these infants were actually born dead. The unfavourable conditions attending parturition in India ensure a high mortality of mothers and infants, but the way is open to gross neglect and, occasionally, to infanticide.

The introductory remarks, and the account given of marriage and the birth-rate, will have prepared the reader for some of the notable characteristics of the mortality figures. The following table affords a review of the death-rates recorded:

‡ Famine in these areas during this period; plague in Bengal, United Provinces, Punjab, Madras, and Bombay.

The 'probable true normal rates' are estimates based on the Census data of 1881 and 1891 by Mr. Hardy, F.I.A., F.S.S.; the rate for all British India being 39.6 per mille (see Census Report, 1891, vol. ii). The Assam rate is probably somewhat higher than that of Bengal, while the rates of the Central Provinces and Berar probably come between those of the United Provinces and Bengal.

We see, first, that, in spite of defective registration, the recorded rates are, generally, very high, and exhibit a progressive rise; they are indeed much above the European standard if Austria-Hungary and Italy be excluded. They vary greatly in different areas during the same period, and in the same areas from year to year; and while this is characteristic of the figures at all times, we have to distinguish the exaggerating effects of special morbidific influences, such as famine. While the progressive rise in the rates is doubtless partly due to improved registration, the inter-Provincial variations are largely the result of differences in the registration error which preclude the use of the figures for any valid comparison of the ordinary vital conditions of different areas. This is made clear if the recorded rates are compared with the 'probable true rates' (column 6); but as the local error varies inappreciably from year to year, the former afford valuable indications of the course of events in each separate area. Lastly, special attention is invited to the remarkable range of fluctuation in the Provincial rates (column 5), and to the figures showing the number of years in which the deaths have exceeded the births in each area (column 7). In all respects the greatest contrast is presented to the English statistics, and this, as we have seen, applies equally to the birth-rate: indeed, the connexion between the vital phenomena is very intimate and direct under the controlling influence of the environment, to the ordinary well-defined variations of which, every now and then, cyclical changes of a catastrophic kind are superadded. These changes, ordinary and extraordinary, are stamped upon the population, influencing its age-constitution, its vitality, and consequently its longevity and its rate of increase, with necessary reaction upon the death-rate. With a fluctuating tendency to increase during ordinary years, there are recurrent halts and local retrocessions which profoundly alter the age-constitution, by the suspension of reproductive power on the one hand, and by excessive mortality, which is most marked at certain ages, on the other. The general effects of famine in this respect have been briefly described, and some of the remarkable features of the death-rates are thus explained.

Before tracing the incidence and causes of the mortality in detail, it is necessary to glance at the age-distribution of the population, not only because it exhibits the vital material exposed to the struggle, but because it marks the effect of past vicissitudes and so affords the best corrective to the death-rates which are inaccurate as to both the numbers and the ages of the dying. The following table shows the numbers per thousand living in India at three age-periods at the Census of 1891 and of 1901, respectively, together with corresponding figures for England and Wales (1901). The influence of the intervening years of famine is shown in the diminished proportion of the under 5 population in India in 1901 as compared with 1891:—

<div style="text-align: center;">Age-distribution of the Population, per 1,000 living.</div>

| England and Wales | 126 | 120 | 777 | 769 | 97 | 111 |

The figures for India (1891) are taken from the adjusted age-tables furnished by Mr. Hardy to the Census Report.

We may now briefly trace the incidence of mortality on age and sex, its chief causes, and their local and seasonal distribution. Any attempt to find a mean that would accurately express the resultant of all the conditions in the struggle could only have, at best, an academic interest when the irregular intervention of profoundly disturbing factors is borne in mind, factors too that operate unequally in different areas. For the present purpose it will be more useful to obtain an idea of the rates which apply to India as a whole under ordinary conditions; and, for the rest, it will suffice to apply the general considerations as to the special effect of famine and the accompanying epidemic diseases, which have been set forth. The inaccuracies in the age returns (Census) and in the registration data render the Provincial records misleading as they stand; but the former may be adjusted, and the latter corrected, in the light of certain local mortality statistics that may be deemed both representative and fairly accurate, the observed rates of increase in the population at different ages affording valuable guidance. In this way Mr. Hardy has been able to arrive at standard rates, which, though largely estimated, may be accepted as approximately accurate. For full details of his methods and results, his valuable contributions to the Indian Census Reports of 1881 and 1891 must be consulted. The following statement, which is based thereon[^3], shows the ordinary death-rates and the expectation of life at the different ages for both sexes, with the corresponding English figures for comparison:—

[^1]: The result of 29,000 observations on healthy prisoners in Bengal showed that 60 per cent. were between 5'2" and 5'4" in height; 13 per cent. were below 5'2", and only 0.7 per cent. above 5'8". The average weight of the healthy Bengali peasant was shown to be 109 lb. (7 stone 11 lb.). In Bombay the physical standard is even lower. (Buchanan, Indian Medical Gazette, October, 1897.)

[^1]: Water-supply systems, conserved on modern principles, are now (1905) at the disposal of ninety communities, having an aggregate population of 6½ millions.

# Sickness and Mortality per 1,000 by Age and Length of Service among the European Troops in India (1895-9)[^1]

These figures are very significant as regards both the details for India and the contrast they afford to the English rates. The excess mortality in India is proportionally greatest at the 5–24 age period, when, however, the deaths represent only 14·25 per cent. of the total at all ages; the next thirty years (25–54) account for 25·5 per cent. of the total mortality; for the rest of life it is 17·7 per cent., leaving 42·6 per cent. to fall upon the 0–5 age period. The heavy loss in the working period of life is of grave import from an economic point of view, especially when the tax paid in sickness and the shorter duration of life are taken into account. It may be assumed that there are probably three cases of sickness for every death, and at this rate the number constantly sick among the 232 millions of British India would amount to nearly 28 millions. This sickness falls heavily upon the adult population, and is generally of a nature that confers no immunity, but—especially in the case of malaria, dysentery and diarrhoea, and lung diseases—rather increases the liability to subsequent attacks. Where it does not temporarily prostrate, as is not infrequently the case, it often involves a lower rate of wages for labourers, and everywhere depresses the moral and physical character, and so forms a potent source of poverty. This view is enforced by the contrast between India and England in respect to the duration of life: between 15 and 35 years of age the probabilities are from 36 to 38 per cent. for males, and from 34 to 48 per cent. for females, less favourable in India: the difference at birth amounts to 79 and 85 per cent., respectively.

In regard to sex, while the estimated death-rates at all ages in India are 40-6 and 38-6 per mille for males and females, respectively, there is a notable contrast in the relative incidence of mortality on the 10-34 age-periods and the rest of life. This is most marked where the male population outnumbers the female—as is the case generally in the north and northwest, and notably in the Punjab and the United Provinces. During the first year of life the female death-rate is lower than the male, but the advantage gradually diminishes, to disappear at the age of 6 to 7. From this point females die off in higher proportion, the excess being greatest at 15-20, after which the difference diminishes until at age 35 it disappears, and thereafter the female rate remains lower. Here doubtless we get a broad indication of the period of procreative life, and of the special dangers that attend it owing to early marriage and the disparity of the ages of parents, to the special insanitary conditions to which the parturient woman is subjected (she being deemed 'unclean' by religious ordinance), and to barbarous midwifery. In many classes of the community the wife takes a large share of bread-winning labour, besides being the domestic drudge. There is abundant evidence of the great prevalence of puerperal fevers and convulsions, and of the frequency of 'accidents,' often induced by the meddlesome methods of native midwives. If we could assume that the difference in the male and female death-rates at the 10-34 age-periods represents the loss of maternal life in child-bed, it would indicate fully 150,000 deaths annually on the present population of British India, or about one death to every 75 live-births[^2]. The Dufferin Association, by the employment of qualified lady doctors and the training of midwives, has done, and is doing, work of inestimable value in the salvation of life and in the diminution of suffering, from which, in time, other important results will follow. The statistics of suicide, which indicate the far greater liability of the female sex to this form of death, give, doubtless, some indication of the disabilities to which women are subject in India, among which a lack of care during illness may be included.

Starting from Ireland and progressing east and south, there is a gradual and regular rise in the mortality of infants, until in India, under ordinary circumstances, probably about one-third of those born die within the first year of life, these deaths constituting about 26 per cent. of the total mortality. The following table gives the rates per 1,000 recorded in the principal Provinces during the ten years ending 1900, with other particulars:—

Although the period includes years in which famine and exceptional epidemic disease prevailed in several areas, it is certain that in nearly every case the above record fails to convey an accurate measure of the loss in ordinary times. Probably this is adequately expressed by the Central Provinces rate alone, while in Madras more than one-third of the deaths are unrecorded. These Provincial rates, moreover, are the means of the District rates, which vary enormously in the same year and under apparently similar conditions. Clearly, defective registration is largely accountable, as is shown by the fact that the rates are consistently highest, and the range lowest, where registration is at its best. If, however, the results in any single area be compared with its own record, valuable indications are afforded of the general state of health and of the material resources of the people. The rates for the famine years are for the whole area calculated on the mean of the births for the year and the one preceding; but if the most severely affected tracts be taken and the calculation be based on the births of the year, the results are more portentous: e.g. in 1900 490 infants were recorded as dying out of 1,000 born in Berar; in Bombay, among a population of seven millions, the rate was 462; and in the worst-stricken areas of the Central Provinces it was over 500. Again, the urban rates (column 5) testify to the specially insanitary conditions of life in the towns, of which an approximate idea may be obtained from the rate of the United Provinces (304), for though famine increased the mortality in some of the areas, this was not the case here in the period taken (1898-1900). Lastly, in the Presidency cities and Rangoon the following rates were recorded: Calcutta 377, Madras 284, Rangoon 402, representing in all cases the means of the five years ending with 1900. In Bombay the mean rate of the twenty years ending 1895 was 421, and for 1896-1900 it was 711; but this, while marking the influence of famine and pestilence, is largely the effect of the very defective registration of births, and of fatalities among the destitute refugees brought into the city to die. The heavy mortality everywhere may be ascribed to the immaturity and ignorance of the mothers, and to the physical labour the majority are called upon to perform; to improper feeding, and to the exposure of infants to all the influences of an insanitary environment wherein the causes of malaria, small-pox, measles, bowel complaints, and tetanus abound. The practice of female infanticide, which but a few years since prevailed among certain high-caste Hindu clans, chiefly in the United Provinces, the Punjab, and Bombay, and to suppress which special laws were enacted, may now be deemed a negligible quantity in the sum of the causes in operation.

The relative influence of urban and rural conditions on the mortality at all ages is a subject that invites extended reference, but it is impossible to do more here than suggest some of the main considerations. Nine-tenths of the people live from the land, the average population of an Indian village being about 360. About twenty-nine millions out of the 294 millions enumerated in 1901 occupy the towns, of which there are altogether 2,148; and of this number 1,427 towns contain less than 10,000 inhabitants, 471 between 10,000 and 20,000, while twenty-nine of the remaining 250 have a population of upwards of 100,000. There is a marked contrast in the conditions of life between the great rural majority and the town minority as regards occupation and the complex influences arising from aggregation in different degrees. A civilization that might be justified in one case is entirely at a disadvantage in the other; and yet we find that as the original court and camp centres of the old régime developed into industrial towns and trade emporia, and while these grew and multiplied, there was no corresponding advance in civic organization, no adjustment to the new conditions. The circumstances were similar to those of camps, and precluded resort to the primitive methods of village conservancy, and year by year the consequences gathered fatal force. During the early period of British rule the governing power was engrossed in extending and consolidating its position, its representatives were few and scattered, and it was part of its policy to refrain from interference with the domestic concerns of the people, who have since shown themselves slow to co-operate in the development of municipal institutions. Much has been accomplished since 1870 by the provision of pure water-supplies, and of drainage and conservancy systems; but the conditions already developed have largely neutralized their effect, and the authorities of the largest cities have now to face the necessity of radical schemes of reconstruction at enormous cost. The following table affords a comparison of the urban and rural death-rates recorded in the different Provinces during the five years ending with 1900: the abnormal sex-distribution, due to an excess of adult males which is a feature of the town populations nearly everywhere save in Madras, while it tends to lower the rates, enhances their significance. It must also be pointed out that famine and plague in recent years have set up cross tides of migration, to and from the towns, which render the records in many centres especially subject to qualification.

<div style="text-align: center;">Mean Death-rate per 1,000 of Population (1896-1900).</div>

The excessive proportion in towns of indoor artisans, of the over-poor, and of the criminal and vicious classes, doubtless involves crowding in cities: a lower average standard of physique. But of all factors in operation, the influence of aggregation is paramount: everywhere the intimacy of the family bond, with its ménage in common often for three generations, entails disabilities in this connexion, but in the larger towns the dangers are greatly enhanced by economic causes. Bombay probably presents an extreme example of conditions which characterize many Indian towns, but which have no parallel in the West. The Census of 1901 discloses that 87 per cent. of all the tenements in Bombay consist of one room only, and that within these 80 per cent. of the population find shelter. In no one of the seven wards of the city is the proportion so accommodated less than 67 per cent., and in two it rises to 88. Each of these single rooms contains on an average 4-2 persons; and with this extremity of density the tenements are aggregated in huge many-storied blocks, with every arrangement, both within and on the site, calculated to defeat the access of light and air and to accumulate damp and faecal products. The conditions are such as to necessitate the constant use of artificial light during the day, and it is scarcely surprising to find that the death-rate from pulmonary phthisis for the whole city averaged 9-4 per mille during 1899 and 1900: in one ward (population 130,000) where the density is greatest, the phthisis death-rate in 1900 was reported to be 16·4 per mille. These results are confirmed by the returns of the local jail, wherein, during the three years ending 1900, 11·6 per mille of average strength died of this disease annually, the rate for London being about 1·8. The low remuneration of labour makes the problem of housing, and of the sanitary conversion of these enormous rookeries in all the large towns, one of stupendous difficulty; and the most strenuous efforts from without will fail of their full effect unless the people co-operate, and evolve a higher standard of domestic hygiene.

Taking the figures for Hindus and Muhammadans under similar conditions, the death-rates are, as a rule, in favour of the latter. This is the more notable as the Musalmāns, as a body, are often included in the poorer sections of the community; they are frequently proselytes from the lower caste Hindus; and in the United Provinces they congregate more largely in the towns. Nevertheless, for the period 1891-1900 the mean death-rate of Muhammadans was lower than that of Hindus in the Punjab, the United Provinces, Madras, Bombay, and Lower Burma, and in Bengal during 1891-96. In the native army, during the five years 1895-9, the mean death-rate of Hindus (all classes) was 8-8 per mille, while that of Muhammadans was only 3-6. Again, the available records of the mortality from plague, while subject to many qualifications, afford testimony to the greater power of resistance which Musalmāns enjoy. Lastly, the death-rate among Eurasians and Native Christians (though race cannot be invoked in the latter case) is almost everywhere invariably lower than that of the general native population. It is probable that the nature and variety of the food play a considerable part in the production of these results.

The following statement will convey a broad general idea of the distribution of the chief causes of mortality, as registered:—

<div style="text-align: center;">Causes of Deaths recorded in all Provinces of British India.</div>

| Cause of death. | 1881-90 a. | | | 1891-1900 f. | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | Number of deaths. | Average annual death-rate per mille. | Percentage to total deaths. | Number of deaths. | Average annual death-rate per mille. | Percentage to total deaths. |
| Cholera . . . Small-pox . . . Fevers . . . Dysentery and diarrhoea . Injuries (snake-bite, suicide, &c.) . . . All other causes | 306,518 122,772 3,359,927 263,608 80,973 934,127 5,067,925 | 1.5 0-6 16.5 1.3 0.4 4.5 | 6.0 2.4 66.3 5.2 1.6 18.4 | 450,502 82,588 4,363,055 278,298 94,082 1,396,936‡ | 2.1 0-4 20.0 1.3 0.4 6.4 | 6.7 1.2 65.5 4.2 1.4 21.0‡ |
| TOTAL | | | | | | |

The previous discussion of the death-rate makes it evident that a large proportion of the mortality is unregistered—of which perhaps 40 per cent. is referable to the deaths of infants. Next, the proportion under each registered cause to the total is, in nearly every case, misleading, notably so as regards the deaths from fevers, bowel complaints, and 'all other causes.' Premising that diseases of the lungs should have been recorded under the last of these heads, and that nearly every fatal illness in which there is a marked rise of temperature is ascribed to 'fever,' it may be affirmed generally that the actual mortality should be much more equally distributed between these three classes. This view is based on the evidence of the returns from the Native army and the jail population, of the civil hospital records, and of the results of special inquiries into the causes of death made by qualified practitioners in certain centres. Malarial fever is, however, doubtless a contributory in the majority of cases, either by lowering natural resistance to other diseases or by actively complicating these. The following statement shows how the recorded mortality is distributed locally, and the composition of the death-rate under ordinary conditions:—

<div style="text-align: center;">Composition of the Death-rate per 1,000, as registered, under Normal Conditions.</div>

| Cause of death. | Bengal. | Assam. | United Provinces. | Punjab. | Central Provinces. | Bihar. | Madras. | Bombay. | Lower Burma. | All India. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cholera . . . Small-pox . . . Fevers . . . Dysentery and diarrhoea . . . All other causes | 2·9 0·2 23·3 5·0 0·7 | 3·7 0·7 18·0 3·1 5·9 | 2·1 0·3 24·9 1·0 4·3 | 0·1 0·8 19·5 0·7 9·4 | 1·8 0·2 21·2 1·8 8·7 | 2·1 0·2 20·1 6·5 12·7 | 1·3 0·6 8·1 0·8 9·6 | 1·5 0·2 21·5 1·8 5·4 | 1·1 0·4 10·7 1·6 8·4 | 2·0 0·3 20·3 1·1 6·4 |
| All causes | 32·1 | 31·4 | 32·6 | 30·5 | 33·7 | 41·6 | 20·4 | 30·4 | 22·2 | 30·1 |

These figures are the means of five years of a fairly normal period (1892–6), and are subject to the qualifications already indicated. The cholera rate of the United Provinces is a little higher than the normal, and for the rest it may be said that the Berar figures most nearly represent the truth. To show how the rates are modified by exceptional causes, the figures recorded in three areas recently affected by famine are subjoined.

<div style="text-align: center;">Mortality rates per 1,000 of Population in Famine Areas.</div>

| PROVINCE. | Cholera. | Small-pox. | Fevers. | Dysentery and diarrhoea. | All other causes. | All causes. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Berar (1900) . Central Provinces (1897) . Central Provinces (1900) . Bombay (1900) . | 6.4 | 0.3 | 29.5 | 22.4 | 24.1 | 82.7 |
| | 6.0 | 0.4 | 41.0 | 8.5 | 13.4 | 69.3 |
| | 7.1 | 0.8 | 28.9 | 5.5 | 15.5 | 57.8 |
| | 8.7 | 0.5 | 28.9 | 11.6 | 20.4 | 70.1 |

This exhibits the effects of a diminished power of resistance to all disease causes, which acquired epidemic force owing to deficient and improper food, impure water, and the wanderings of the people in search of work and relief.

The ordinary causes of sickness and mortality may be said to fall mainly into three great classes. First, the specific fevers, including malaria, small-pox, influenza, Malta fever, cerebrospinal meningitis, typhus, and doubtless others that await differentiation. Second, those affecting the abdominal organs: notably cholera and enteric fevers, dysentery and diarrhoea. Lastly, the lung diseases—tubercle, pneumonia, bronchitis, &c.; the first two being specific infections, and all frequently the sequelae of fevers and bowel complaints. Another fact of great significance is the wide prevalence of intestinal and skin parasites, and of ulcers and other indications of scurvy. Thus, an overwhelming proportion of the sickness and mortality is due to diseases of which the salient property is communicability; and, at the same time, there is the evidence of deficient powers of resistance, and of insanitary habits and surroundings, viz. aggregation, foul air, deficient and impure water, and defective conservancy, including drainage. Each of the three groups of disease above mentioned can be causally associated with one or more of these defects, and it will be found that the composition of the death-rate varies locally with the degree of operation of these factors. Where, as in Bengal, the chief difficulties are connected with drainage and the conservancy of the water-supplies, we see a larger proportion of malarial fevers and of bowel complaints; where, as in the Punjab, the social customs and the climate lead to crowding in ill-ventilated tenements, the other specific fevers and lung diseases are more fatal. Climate, then, operates by favouring the life processes of the micro-organic causes of disease, and by influencing the food supplies and the density of the population, and also its domestic habits, of which the most important is the degree of aggregation. Limits of space preclude an examination of the seasonal incidence of mortality in the different areas which would make this clear, and the Provincial and special reports should be consulted. Nothing could be more striking than the obvious relation which the rainfall bears to the prevalence of fevers and of bowel complaints. There is an extraordinary rise in the mortality curve from both with the establishment of the monsoon; but as dysentery and diarrhoea (and cholera is subject to the same conditions) depend chiefly on impurities washed into the water-supplies by the first deluge after drought, their maximum is reached earlier than in the case of fevers, which depend on the formation of stagnant collections of water and the causes of which require a longer period of incubation and are less quickly fatal. In the case of both fever and bowel complaints there is a fall through the winter, with a smaller secondary rise in the hot weather, due probably to concentration of pollution of the water-supplies and to irrigation for agricultural purposes; and some of the fevers are then, possibly, of the enteric class, though malarial fevers also increase at this time. Small-pox, as in England, is more markedly prevalent in the winter, spring, and early summer, with a decided fall below the mean from July to November. Diseases of the lungs are most fatal during the rains and in the winter months, when, in addition to vicissitudes of climate, the people are crowded in their dwellings.

The circumstances under which excessive mortality from epidemics occurs have been generally indicated in the previous pages; and relapsing fever, dengue, and plague have to be added to the list of the specific fevers in this connexion. They are the results of some marked change in the relations of the aggregate of individuals to the environment, or of some exaggeration of the force of one or more of the factors. Failure of the rains, by diminishing the food-supply, has an immense and immediate effect on the vital powers of the population, lowering its resistance to all ordinary and extraordinary causes of mortality, while facilitating their propagation. On the other hand there is the danger of excess of rainfall; of cyclonic storms; of inundations from overflow of rivers, to which both the drier and the wetter tracts are subject. More gradual, but persistently fatal, are the results, in the shape of epidemic fevers, of the geographical transformations incident to the building up of land in deltaic areas, involving floods and alterations in the courses of rivers and of the natural drainage. The effects of aggregation vary with the conditions: on the one hand, an outbreak of cholera or small-pox among a concourse of pilgrims; on the other, the more gradual evolution of conditions that invite the ravages of plague and typhus.

The record of small-pox is very imperfect for the first seventy years of the nineteenth century: inoculation was widely practised and vaccination only made its way slowly against the prejudices of the people. The number of operations in India in 1850 did not exceed 350,000, but since then the quality and quantity of the work have steadily increased, the number of persons now annually protected exceeding eight millions. The figures below are interesting, and there is little doubt of the diagnosis of this disease, with which the most ignorant are familiar. The figures show a decrease in the mortality, account being taken of the growth of population, which represents the saving of about 1,160,000 lives in the third period as compared with the first, although, owing to plague and famine, all the conditions, save vaccination, were more favourable to the disease in 1890–1900.

For an account of the present plague epidemic the reader must be referred to the official reports, and especially to that of the Indian Commission of 1898-9. Since the recognition of the outbreak in Bombay in August, 1896, it has appeared in epidemic form in six of the Provinces of British India, and in several of the Native States. The aggregate number of deaths from plague recorded up to the end of 1903 amounted to 2,105,548, distributed, in round numbers, as follows: Bombay, including Sind, 934,000; Punjab, 454,000; Bengal, 178,000; United Provinces, 129,000; Central Provinces, 43,000; Madras, 30,000; Central India, 30,000; Mysore, 88,000; Hyderabad, 44,000; Kashmir, 10,000; Rajputana, 3,000. The record of deaths for Bombay city for the same period is 113,129, and for Calcutta 34,769.

The European army in India provides a select population of adult males (with a smaller number of women and children), aliens to the country and climate, and subject to the vicissitudes of war. The Native army consists of the pick of the manhood of the various indigenous races, also liable to war risks and to service outside their original habitat, a change to which most natives are peculiarly sensitive; while the majority of the prisoners represent the destitute and vicious sections of the general population. All these classes have been under daily medical observation for many years, the records of which possess a substantial scientific value, and there is also a large mass of literature dealing with many of the problems of public health. To these detailed sources of information, the most important of which are indicated in the Bibliography at the end of this chapter, we must refer the reader who would pursue the investigation of the many questions that arise out of the bare statement of the main facts, which is all that space admits of here. In regard to the brief historical review presented, it must be noted that the sanitary awakening in England, though heralded by a few army and navy surgeons at the end of the eighteenth century, may be dated from the middle of the nineteenth century. After the first Public Health Act (1848), there was little progress until the question of army sanitary reform engaged the attention of Royal Commissions in England (1858) and in India (1863), with important legislative results in both countries. A Sanitary Department was organized in India in 1864; but many medical officers had already been calling attention to defaults in the hygiene of the troops and prisoners, and considerable progress in amelioration had been made before the Indian Commission was appointed. The movement was therefore roughly synchronous with that in England.

The first table below shows the gross death-rates among European troops per mille of strength for periods commencing roughly with the term of office of the first Governor-General and ending with the Mutiny; and the table which follows, which also gives the rates per mille, affords some idea of the chief causes of mortality. It must be remembered, however, that during these periods wars were much more frequent than has been the case subsequently.

The extent of the sickness may be gathered from the fact that, during the whole period, the men were admitted to hospital at the rate of over 2,000 per mille of strength, while the loss by invaliding amounted to 29 per mille. The Royal Commission of 1863 expressed the opinion that a death-rate of 20 per mille might 'be taken as the possible mortality under improved sanitary conditions,' and the record of the first twenty years of what may be termed the sanitary era will show how soon their anticipations were to be more than realized:—

<div style="text-align: center;">Sickness and Mortality per 1,000 among the European Troops in India, 1870–89.</div>

| Period. | Admissions to hospital (all causes). | Deaths from | | | | | In-validing. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | Cholera. | Enteric fever. | Other fevers. | Hepatitis. | Dysentery and diarrhoea. | All causes. | |
| 1870-9 | 1,475 | 3-2 | 2-0 | 1-4 | 2-1 | 1-6 | 19-3 | 43 |
| 1880-9 | 1,493 | 1-7 | 3-7 | 0-9 | 1-4 | 1-2 | 15-7 | 27 |

That is to say, an average death-rate of about 70 per mille during the first half of the century had been reduced to an average of 17·5, which is equal to a saving of over 100,000 lives on the average strength in the last thirty years. The following figures show the position during the six years ending with 1900:—

<div style="text-align: center;">Sickness and Mortality per 1,000 among the European Troops in India, 1895–1900.</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">A = Admissions to hospital; D = Deaths.</div>

If field operations be excluded, the death-rate for India falls to 15·6 per mille. Out of every thousand men, 30 were invalided annually, but of these only 10·6 for discharge from the service. The following statement shows how the liability to sickness and mortality is affected by age and length of foreign service:—

<div style="text-align: center;">Sickness and Mortality per 1,000 by Age and Length of Service among the European Troops in India (1895-9)[^1].</div>

[^1]: The decade 1891–1901 has been ignored, owing to the abnormal conditions of famine and plague.

[^2]: In London in the seventeenth century it was about 1 to 40; in England it is now about 1 to 212.

| 5—10 years | . | . | 1,244 | 9.9 | 14.1 | 2.8 | 29.1 |

The marked effect of enteric fever on the relative age incidence of mortality will be noted. Lastly, more than half the total invaliding is due to four classes of disease: namely, venereal diseases, 23 per cent.; intermittent and remittent fevers, 11; diseases of the heart and circulation, 11; and debility, 9 per cent.

The mortality among officers of the Company's service during the period 1814–33 is stated to have been at the rate of 38 per mille of strength per annum, and that for officers of the Royal Army in India, 34 per mille: the contrast afforded by the figures for the six years ending with 1900, in which it fell to 14·4 per mille, is striking and instructive. The chief causes of mortality are similar to those affecting the troops, though there is a lower fatality under each head save cholera.

The early records of sickness and mortality among the women connected with the European army are scanty and unreliable; but in the Bengal army the average annual death-rate for the four years before the Mutiny was 44·5 per mille, and this rose to 49·6 during the four years following. It fell to an average (for India) of 24·5 per mille during the first decade of the sanitary era, and the present improved conditions are shown by the fact that in 1895–1900 it was only 16.6 per mille.

The average annual death-rate among European soldiers' children in the Bengal army during the four years prior to the Mutiny was 84·1 per mille, and it rose to 93·3 in the decade-ending 1870, the mortality from cholera accounting for 11·2 of the total. The effect of sanitary measures is perceptible in the decrease to 67·8 per mille (for India) in 1871-80, and to 44·4 for the six years ending with 1900. Of the mortality of recent years 94 per cent. occurs within the first five years of life: the average death-rate for the first year is 195 per mille, and for the 0-5 age-period 71, or about 15 more than that in England and Wales. Measles and whooping cough caused annually 50 cases of sickness among every 1,000 children, and diphtheria and croup accounted for 25 deaths in the six years ending 1900, a rate of 0·74 per annum.

It is impossible to obtain an accurate measure of the sickness and mortality of the Native troops in the past, for the records take no account of that occurring among the men who were absent from their regiments on leave. While some general idea may be obtained from the following statement, which mainly corresponds to the second quarter of the nineteenth century, it may be said that the true gross death-rate probably amounted then to at least 22 per mille:—

| PRESIDENCY ARMY. | PERIOD 1833-53* | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | RATIOS PER MILLE OF STRENGTH OF DEATHS FROM | | | | |
| | Cholera. | Dysentery and diarrhoea. | Phthisis. | Fevers. | All causes. |
| Bengal . . | 1.81 | 1.6 | 0.22 | 5.1 | 14.4 |
| Bombay . . | 2.29 | 1.9 | 0.45 | 5.5 | 15.8 |
| Madras . . | 7.34 | 2.1 | . . | 2.8 | 18.8 |
| All India . . | 2.9 | 1.8 | 0.22 | 4.8 | 15.6 |

Passing over the next twenty-five years, the records for which are similarly vitiated but indicate little change in the conditions, we come to the first decade of the sanitary era (1871-80), when the admissions to hospital averaged 1,287 per mille of strength, and the death-rate 20·3[^1], while 34 men in every thousand were invalidated for discharge. We may now examine the position in 1895-1900, as set forth in the following table:—

Sickness and Mortality per 1,000 in the Native Army of India (1895-1900).

| Constantly sick. | Cholera. | Fevers: intermittent, remittent, and simple continued. | Tubercle of lungs. | Other respiratory diseases. | Dysentery and diarrhoea. | Venereal diseases. | All causes. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | 1.5 / 0.9 | 327.9 / 1.8 | 3.0 / 0.7 | 43.6 / 4.0 | 58.7 / 0.7 | 37.5 / 0.1 | 782.9 / 11.7 |

A = Admissions to hospital ; D = Deaths.

To this, which shows a reduction in the mortality of nearly 50 per cent., equal to an annual saving of over 1,200 lives, it may be added that the invaliding rate has fallen to 13 per mille of strength. Enteric fever caused only 204 admissions and 67 deaths during the six years, yielding ratios of 0.3 and 0.09 per mille per annum, respectively: that is to say, the European troops are about 88 times more liable to this disease, from which the mortality to strength is nearly 80 times greater, than are the troops of the Native army.

The following statement exhibits (per 1,000) the general character of the jail mortuary statistics during a period which corresponds roughly to the second quarter of the nineteenth century:—

| PRISONERS IN THE JAILS OF PRESIDENCIES. | Period. | Admissions to hospital (all causes). | DEATHS FROM | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | Fevers. | Dysentery and diarrhoea. | Cholera. | Pulmonary phthisis. | All causes. |
| Bengal | 1833-54 | 1,235 | 10-9 | 21-7 | 8-7 | 1-3 | 72-5 |
| Bombay | 1831-53 | 1,281 | 13-1 | 15-0 | 10-9 | 0-7 | 61-5 |
| Madras | 1844-53 | 1,050 | 4-4 | 17-0 | 15-1 | 2-6 | 61-3 |
| India | . | 1,230 | 10-8 | 20-7 | 9-3 | 1-3 | 70-7 |

During the next seventeen years there was little improvement. The death-rate for Bengal averaged 68.2 per mille, but in Bombay it fell to 44.2, while in Madras it rose to 78.5 owing chiefly to outbreaks of cholera. This brings us to the year 1870, the commencement of the sanitary era and of the appointment of medical officers to the full administrative charge of jails. During 1871-80 the average death-rate in Bengal was 46.6 per mille, and in Bombay 53.7. In Madras it was still as high as 73.9, but two-thirds of the mortality occurred in famine years (1877-8). If this period be excluded, the Madras rate falls to 36 per mille, and the combined rate for all India to 46.4. We may now examine in detail the record of the twenty years ending with 1900, and in order to convey an idea of the present position, the figures for 1881-94 and 1895-1900 are given separately. In the latter period they are deduced from an average annual strength, for all India, of 112,951 prisoners.

| | 1895-00 | 39 | 1,099 | 2-1 | 1-5 | 9-1 | 5-0 | |

*Under 'fevers' are grouped 'intermittent,' 'remittent,' 'simple continued' and 'enteric' fevers, the death ratio of 2.15 (1895-1900—all India) being made up thus: intermittent 0.95, remittent 1.05, simple continued 0.04, and enteric 0.11. Intermittent fevers cause four times as many admissions as remittent and half as many again as simple continued: there were only 168 cases of enteric in all the jails during the six years period.

† Famine in 1896–7 and in 1900.

This shows a reduction in the combined death-rate (India) of nearly 60 per cent. compared with the period up to 1870. It must be noted, too, that during 1895-1900 famine and exceptional epidemic disease prevailed in at least five of the Provinces, and affected the population in nearly all, driving to crime large numbers of the destitute, many of whom were admitted to jail in the last stages of disease and want. In the three years 1901-3 the death-rates for all India have fallen to 26.8, 24.8, and 21.4 per mille respectively.

It is calculated that under normal conditions the death-rate of the free population between the ages of 20 and 64 is about 29 per mille, so that the present jail death-rate affords testimony to the care and skill bestowed on the prisoners, who are for the most part drawn from the poorest and most deprived sections of the community. As regards the causes of mortality, it will be seen that the proportion borne to the total by the sum of the four classes of disease distinguished in the table on page 530 is 54 per cent. in the last period (1895-1900), against 59 per cent. in the first (1833-53). There has, therefore, been little or no change in the nature and type of the chief disease causes; but the death-rate from cholera has decreased by 7.8 per mille, that from fevers by 8.7, that from dysentery by 11.6, or by about 28 per mille under the three heads, while the phthisis rate has increased by 1.9, owing doubtless to improved diagnosis. The death-rate from small-pox (1895-1900) was only 0.07 per mille.

## Comparison of European and Native troops and prisoners as regards disease statistics.

Finally, it will be instructive to compare the incidence of the chief causes of sickness and mortality on the three classes hitherto discussed (European and Native troops and prisoners), taking the mean results for the five years 1895-9.

In every 100 admissions to hospital there were among :—

| EUROPEAN TROOPS. | Cases. | NATIVE TROOPS. | Cases. | PRISONERS. | Cases. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Venereal diseases | 31-2 | Intermittent fever | 38-3 | Intermittent fever | 34-2 |
| Intermittent fever | 22-6 | Dysentery | 5-9 | Dysentery | 9-9 |
| Simple continued fever | 2-4 | Venereal diseases | 4-6 | Abscess, ulcer, and boils | 9-1 |
| Dysentery | 2-3 | Respiratory diseases* | 3-6 | Diarrhoea | 6-1 |
| Respiratory diseases* | 1-8 | Remittent fever | 2-1 | Respiratory diseases* | 3-6 |
| | | | | Simple continued fever | 2-3 |

* Excluding tubercle and pneumonia.

In every 100 deaths there were among :—

| EUROPEAN TROOPS. | Cases. | NATIVE TROOPS. | Cases. | PRISONERS. | Cases. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Enteric fever | 43-4 | Pneumonia | 31-6 | Dysentery | 24-2 |
| Hepatic abscess | 8-1 | Remittent fever | 9-9 | Pneumonia | 14-1 |
| Dysentery | 6-3 | Tubercle of lungs | 6-0 | Tubercle of lungs | 11-1 |
| Heat-stroke | 4-8 | Intermittent fever | 5-3 | Diarrhoea | 7-0 |
| Pneumonia | 3-7 | Cholera | 4-4 | Anaemia and debility | 5-7 |
| Tubercle of lungs | | Respiratory diseases* | 4-3 | Cholera | |
| Circulatory diseases | 3-0 | Dysentery | 4-1 | Respiratory diseases* | 4-1 |
| | | | | Remittent fever | |
| | | | | Intermittent fever | |

As regards sickness, the Europeans are specially liable to a class of disorder from which the natives under comparison are much freer, owing largely to marriage or incarceration. In regard to the mortality, we see the pre-eminent fatality of specific bowel and lung diseases, though its relative measure varies with the circumstances, including the susceptibility and vitality of the subjects. The disabilities of the class from which the prisoners are drawn have been alluded to; those of the Native troops are largely due to exposure to strange climates, not necessarily outside India, and to their freedom to indulge their ingrained domestic customs in barracks. If it were not for enteric fever, the probabilities of life for the European troops would be as good as for males at the same ages in England; but the subject is too extensive and intricate for discussion here, and is dealt with at length in the reports about to be mentioned. The prospects of a further diminution of the present comparatively low death-rate lie chiefly in the direction of the prevention of this disease, and that it will be achieved to a large extent admits of little doubt.

The following statement of the sickness and mortality (per 1,000) from cholera among the troops and prisoners in Bengal, the 'home' of the disease, may fitly close this brief review, as it affords a significant summary of the results of the application of sanitary measures to which the foregoing pages bear ample testimony:—

| PERIOD. | European Troops. | | PERIOD. | Native Troops. | | PERIOD. | Prisoners. | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | Cases. | Deaths. | | Cases. | Deaths. | | Cases. | Deaths. |
| 1818-27 | 29.8 | 8.8 | 1831-53 | 8.3 | 3.0* | 1833-54 | 20.5 | 8.8 |
| 1828-37 | 33.7 | 8.0 | | | | | | |
| 1838-47 | 32.2 | 13.0 | | | | | | |
| 1848-57 | 20.0 | 9.2 | 1861-70 | 5.0 | 2.5* | 1859-70 | 21.8 | 8.9 |
| 1858-67 | 15.1 | 9.1 | 1870-4 | 2.0 | 1.1 | 1870-4 | 7.0 | 2.8 |
| 1870-4 | 4.1 | 2.6 | 1875-9 | 2.8 | 1.6 | 1875-9 | 8.8 | 4.3 |
| 1875-9 | 5.4 | 3.8 | 1880-4 | 1.1 | 0.7 | 1880-4 | 4.0 | 2.2 |
| 1880-4 | 3.3 | 2.3 | 1885-9 | 1.7 | 1.1 | 1885-9 | 6.2 | 3.6 |
| 1885-9 | 2.2 | 1.4 | 1890-4 | 2.6 | 1.6 | 1890-4 | 3.7 | 2.1 |
| 1890-4 | 2.7 | 1.9 | 1895-1900 | 1.3 | 0.9 | 1895-1900 | 4.1 | 2.3 |
| 1895-1900 | 1.5 | 1.1 | | | | | | |

These figures refer to communities over the physical conditions of which the Government and its officers exercise more or less control, though the troops live among, and come into constant contact with, the general population. Moreover, there are conditions inalienable from the concentration of large bodies of men in barracks or jails which enhance the difficulties of excluding sickness of a communicable nature. The results prior and subsequent to the sanitary era may be contrasted; and it should be noted that the period 1895–1900 is one in which cholera among the general population was, owing to famine and scarcity, prevalent beyond all previous record.
