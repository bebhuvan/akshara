Romesh Chunder Dutt, C.I.E. (Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire) was a pioneering Indian civil servant, historian, and translator who bridged Eastern and Western cultures through his scholarly work. A barrister-at-law and member of both the Royal Asiatic Society and the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Dutt dedicated his life to making Indian civilization, history, and literature accessible to English readers.

## Literary Contributions

Dutt's most enduring literary achievement is his translation work, which introduced English readers to the wealth of ancient Indian poetry. His *Lays of Ancient India* (1894) presented carefully selected passages spanning five distinct periods of Indian literary history:

- **Vedic Hymns** (2000-1400 BC): Fresh, joyous hymns from the Rig Veda
- **The Upanishads** (1400-1000 BC): Sublime philosophical poetry on the Universal Soul
- **Buddhist Scriptures** (1000-320 BC): Noble teachings from the Pali canon
- **Edicts of Asoka** (320 BC-500 AD): Imperial proclamations of righteousness
- **Kāvya Poetry** (500-1200 AD): Classical Sanskrit poetry including works by Kālidāsa

## Historical Work

Beyond translation, Dutt was a respected historian who wrote *A History of Civilisation in Ancient India*, tracing the development of Indian society through its successive periods. His work on Indian economic history, particularly *The Economic History of India Under Early British Rule*, provided critical analysis of British colonial policies and their impact on India.

## Civil Service Career

As one of the first Indians admitted to the Indian Civil Service, Dutt broke barriers and served with distinction. He rose to become the first Indian Divisional Commissioner of Orissa, demonstrating that Indians could excel in the highest administrative positions.

## Personal Life

Dutt was a devoted father who dedicated his *Lays of Ancient India* to his loving daughters Amala and Sarala "with a father's blessing and love." Writing from Wiesbaden, Germany in August-September 1893, he completed this major work while acknowledging his "unfitness for undertaking such a task in a language which is not my mother tongue"—a humility that belied the excellence of his English prose and verse.

## Legacy

Dutt's translations remain valuable for their clarity and poetic sensibility. Unlike mere literal renderings, his verse translations captured the spirit and beauty of the original Sanskrit and Pali texts while making them accessible to Western readers. His work contributed to the growing appreciation of Indian culture in late Victorian Britain and helped establish the study of Indian literature as a serious academic field.

His dual roles as administrator and scholar exemplified the possibilities of East-West cultural exchange in the colonial period, and his dedication to preserving and presenting India's literary heritage ensured that ancient Indian voices would continue to resonate with modern readers.
