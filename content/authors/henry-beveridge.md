Henry Beveridge was a Scottish historian and colonial administrator whose comprehensive histories of India remain valuable sources for understanding the subcontinent's past. A distinguished member of the Bengal Civil Service, he combined administrative duties with serious historical scholarship.

## A Comprehensive History of India

Beveridge's most ambitious work was his three-volume *A Comprehensive History of India*, published in 1862. Written just five years after the Sepoy Mutiny, this sweeping narrative covered India from ancient times through the rebellion and its aftermath. The work is notable for:

- **Volume I**: Ancient and medieval India, the rise of the Mughal Empire, and the founding of the East India Company
- **Volume II**: Hindu institutions and civilization, plus the critical period from 1765 to 1813
- **Volume III**: British expansion and the events leading to the Mutiny

## Civil Service Career

Beveridge served in the Bengal Civil Service for over 35 years, holding positions as District Magistrate and Collector in various districts. His administrative experience gave him firsthand knowledge of Indian society, which informed his historical writing.

## Translation Work

In retirement, Beveridge devoted himself to translating important Persian historical texts, including Abu'l-Fazl's *Akbar-nama*, the official chronicle of Emperor Akbar's reign. This work made primary source material accessible to English-speaking scholars and remains a standard reference.

## Legacy

Beveridge's historical works, while products of their colonial era, provide detailed narrative accounts of Indian history that draw on extensive primary sources. His combination of administrative experience, linguistic skills, and scholarly dedication produced works that continue to be consulted by historians of South Asia.
