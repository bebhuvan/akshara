Sir William Wilson Hunter (1840-1900) was a distinguished Scottish historian, statistician, and civil servant who devoted much of his life to studying and documenting India. Born in Glasgow, he joined the Indian Civil Service in 1862 and quickly established himself as a scholar of exceptional ability.

Hunter's most significant achievement was directing the compilation of the  **Imperial Gazetteer of India**, a comprehensive geographical and statistical survey of the entire subcontinent. This monumental work, published in multiple volumes, became the definitive reference for Indian geography, demographics, and administration.

His historical works, particularly *A Brief History of the Indian Peoples* (first published in 1882), were notable for their balanced approach. Unlike many contemporary British historians who presented India primarily as a conquered territory, Hunter gave proper weight to India's ancient civilizations, the contributions of various Indian peoples, and the development of Hindu and Buddhist cultures.

## Major Works

- *A Brief History of the Indian Peoples* (1882, with numerous editions through 1903)
- *The Imperial Gazetteer of India* (9 volumes, 1881; expanded to 14 volumes in later editions)
- *Annals of Rural Bengal* (1868)
- *The Indian Musalmans* (1871)
- *Orissa* (2 volumes, 1872)
- *A Statistical Account of Bengal* (20 volumes, 1875-1877)

## Legacy

Hunter was knighted in 1887 for his services to Indian administration and scholarship. His works remain important historical sources for understanding 19th-century India. The systematic approach he brought to documenting India's geography, demographics, and history set standards for colonial scholarship and provided valuable data for future historians.

His *Brief History* went through 23 editions and was translated into multiple Indian languages, becoming a standard textbook in Indian universities. It was praised for presenting Indian history as a continuous narrative of civilization rather than merely as background to British conquest.

Hunter died in 1900, shortly before the publication of his final edition of the *Imperial Gazetteer*. His statistical methods and comprehensive approach to documenting India influenced generations of administrators and scholars.
