Friedrich Max Müller was one of the most influential scholars of the 19th century, a towering figure in the fields of comparative philology, mythology, and religion. Though he never visited India, his work did more than perhaps any other single scholar's to bring Sanskrit literature to Western attention.

## The Rig Veda Edition

Müller's crowning achievement was his critical edition of the Rig Veda with Sayana's Sanskrit commentary, published in six volumes between 1849 and 1874. This monumental work, sponsored by the East India Company, made the oldest Hindu scriptures accessible to European scholars for the first time in a reliable text.

## Advocacy for India

Unlike many Victorian scholars who approached India with colonial condescension, Müller was a passionate advocate for Indian civilization. In his Cambridge lectures *India: What Can It Teach Us?* (1883), he argued eloquently that Sanskrit studies should be central to liberal education, defended the character of Hindus against colonial slanders, and revealed the profound lessons Vedic literature could teach the West.

## Comparative Religion

Müller was a pioneer in the scientific study of religion. He edited the monumental *Sacred Books of the East* series (50 volumes, 1879-1910), which translated key texts from Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Islam, and other Eastern religions. His lectures on the science of religion helped establish comparative religion as an academic discipline.

## Legacy

Müller's work profoundly shaped Western understanding of India. His translations, editions, and popular writings introduced generations of readers to Vedic hymns, the Upanishads, and the Buddha's teachings. While some of his theories have been superseded, his passion for Sanskrit and his belief in the shared heritage of Indo-European peoples remain influential.
